| **[Using Powerful Prior Knowledge of Diffusion Model in Deep Unfolding Networks for Image Compressive Sensing](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.08429v1)** | 2025-03-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recently, Deep Unfolding Networks (DUNs) have achieved impressive reconstruction quality in the field of image Compressive Sensing (CS) by unfolding iterative optimization algorithms into neural networks. The reconstruction quality of DUNs depends on the learned prior knowledge, so introducing stronger prior knowledge can further improve reconstruction quality. On the other hand, pre-trained diffusion models contain powerful prior knowledge and have a solid theoretical foundation and strong scalability, but it requires a large number of iterative steps to achieve reconstruction. In this paper, we propose to use the powerful prior knowledge of pre-trained diffusion model in DUNs to achieve high-quality reconstruction with less steps for image CS. Specifically, we first design an iterative optimization algorithm named Diffusion Message Passing (DMP), which embeds a pre-trained diffusion model into each iteration process of DMP. Then, we deeply unfold the DMP algorithm into a neural network named DMP-DUN. The proposed DMP-DUN can use lightweight neural networks to achieve mapping from measurement data to the intermediate steps of the reverse diffusion process and directly approximate the divergence of the diffusion model, thereby further improving reconstruction efficiency. Extensive experiments show that our proposed DMP-DUN achieves state-of-the-art performance and requires at least only 2 steps to reconstruct the image.

| **[Invertible Diffusion Models for Compressed Sensing](http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.17006v2)** | 2025-02-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>While deep neural networks (NN) significantly advance image compressed sensing (CS) by improving reconstruction quality, the necessity of training current CS NNs from scratch constrains their effectiveness and hampers rapid deployment. Although recent methods utilize pre-trained diffusion models for image reconstruction, they struggle with slow inference and restricted adaptability to CS. To tackle these challenges, this paper proposes Invertible Diffusion Models (IDM), a novel efficient, end-to-end diffusion-based CS method. IDM repurposes a large-scale diffusion sampling process as a reconstruction model, and fine-tunes it end-to-end to recover original images directly from CS measurements, moving beyond the traditional paradigm of one-step noise estimation learning. To enable such memory-intensive end-to-end fine-tuning, we propose a novel two-level invertible design to transform both (1) multi-step sampling process and (2) noise estimation U-Net in each step into invertible networks. As a result, most intermediate features are cleared during training to reduce up to 93.8% GPU memory. In addition, we develop a set of lightweight modules to inject measurements into noise estimator to further facilitate reconstruction. Experiments demonstrate that IDM outperforms existing state-of-the-art CS networks by up to 2.64dB in PSNR. Compared to the recent diffusion-based approach DDNM, our IDM achieves up to 10.09dB PSNR gain and 14.54 times faster inference. Code is available at https://github.com/Guaishou74851/IDM.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted for publication in IEEE Transactions on Pattern Analysis and Machine Intelligence (TPAMI)</p></details> |
| **[WTDUN: Wavelet Tree-Structured Sampling and Deep Unfolding Network for Image Compressed Sensing](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.16336v1)** | 2024-11-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Deep unfolding networks have gained increasing attention in the field of compressed sensing (CS) owing to their theoretical interpretability and superior reconstruction performance. However, most existing deep unfolding methods often face the following issues: 1) they learn directly from single-channel images, leading to a simple feature representation that does not fully capture complex features; and 2) they treat various image components uniformly, ignoring the characteristics of different components. To address these issues, we propose a novel wavelet-domain deep unfolding framework named WTDUN, which operates directly on the multi-scale wavelet subbands. Our method utilizes the intrinsic sparsity and multi-scale structure of wavelet coefficients to achieve a tree-structured sampling and reconstruction, effectively capturing and highlighting the most important features within images. Specifically, the design of tree-structured reconstruction aims to capture the inter-dependencies among the multi-scale subbands, enabling the identification of both fine and coarse features, which can lead to a marked improvement in reconstruction quality. Furthermore, a wavelet domain adaptive sampling method is proposed to greatly improve the sampling capability, which is realized by assigning measurements to each wavelet subband based on its importance. Unlike pure deep learning methods that treat all components uniformly, our method introduces a targeted focus on important subbands, considering their energy and sparsity. This targeted strategy lets us capture key information more efficiently while discarding less important information, resulting in a more effective and detailed reconstruction. Extensive experimental results on various datasets validate the superior performance of our proposed method.</p></details> | <details><summary>20pag...</summary><p>20pages,Accepted by ACM Transactions on Multimedia Computing Communications and Applications (TOMM)</p></details> |
| **[Differentiable SVD based on Moore-Penrose Pseudoinverse for Inverse Imaging Problems](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.14141v1)** | 2024-11-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Low-rank regularization-based deep unrolling networks have achieved remarkable success in various inverse imaging problems (IIPs). However, the singular value decomposition (SVD) is non-differentiable when duplicated singular values occur, leading to severe numerical instability during training. In this paper, we propose a differentiable SVD based on the Moore-Penrose pseudoinverse to address this issue. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work to provide a comprehensive analysis of the differentiability of the trivial SVD. Specifically, we show that the non-differentiability of SVD is essentially due to an underdetermined system of linear equations arising in the derivation process. We utilize the Moore-Penrose pseudoinverse to solve the system, thereby proposing a differentiable SVD. A numerical stability analysis in the context of IIPs is provided. Experimental results in color image compressed sensing and dynamic MRI reconstruction show that our proposed differentiable SVD can effectively address the numerical instability issue while ensuring computational precision.

| **[Uformer-ICS: A U-Shaped Transformer for Image Compressive Sensing Service](http://arxiv.org/abs/2209.01763v2)** | 2024-07-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Many service computing applications require real-time dataset collection from multiple devices, necessitating efficient sampling techniques to reduce bandwidth and storage pressure. Compressive sensing (CS) has found wide-ranging applications in image acquisition and reconstruction. Recently, numerous deep-learning methods have been introduced for CS tasks. However, the accurate reconstruction of images from measurements remains a significant challenge, especially at low sampling rates. In this paper, we propose Uformer-ICS as a novel U-shaped transformer for image CS tasks by introducing inner characteristics of CS into transformer architecture. To utilize the uneven sparsity distribution of image blocks, we design an adaptive sampling architecture that allocates measurement resources based on the estimated block sparsity, allowing the compressed results to retain maximum information from the original image. Additionally, we introduce a multi-channel projection (MCP) module inspired by traditional CS optimization methods. By integrating the MCP module into the transformer blocks, we construct projection-based transformer blocks, and then form a symmetrical reconstruction model using these blocks and residual convolutional blocks. Therefore, our reconstruction model can simultaneously utilize the local features and long-range dependencies of image, and the prior projection knowledge of CS theory. Experimental results demonstrate its significantly better reconstruction performance than state-of-the-art deep learning-based CS methods.</p></details> |  |
| **[Deep Network for Image Compressed Sensing Coding Using Local Structural Sampling](http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.19111v1)** | 2024-02-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Existing image compressed sensing (CS) coding frameworks usually solve an inverse problem based on measurement coding and optimization-based image reconstruction, which still exist the following two challenges: 1) The widely used random sampling matrix, such as the Gaussian Random Matrix (GRM), usually leads to low measurement coding efficiency. 2) The optimization-based reconstruction methods generally maintain a much higher computational complexity. In this paper, we propose a new CNN based image CS coding framework using local structural sampling (dubbed CSCNet) that includes three functional modules: local structural sampling, measurement coding and Laplacian pyramid reconstruction. In the proposed framework, instead of GRM, a new local structural sampling matrix is first developed, which is able to enhance the correlation between the measurements through a local perceptual sampling strategy. Besides, the designed local structural sampling matrix can be jointly optimized with the other functional modules during training process. After sampling, the measurements with high correlations are produced, which are then coded into final bitstreams by the third-party image codec. At last, a Laplacian pyramid reconstruction network is proposed to efficiently recover the target image from the measurement domain to the image domain. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that the proposed scheme outperforms the existing state-of-the-art CS coding methods, while maintaining fast computational speed.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by ACM Transactions on Multimedia Computing Communications and Applications (TOMM)</p></details> |
| **[MB-RACS: Measurement-Bounds-based Rate-Adaptive Image Compressed Sensing Network](http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.16855v1)** | 2024-01-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Conventional compressed sensing (CS) algorithms typically apply a uniform sampling rate to different image blocks. A more strategic approach could be to allocate the number of measurements adaptively, based on each image block's complexity. In this paper, we propose a Measurement-Bounds-based Rate-Adaptive Image Compressed Sensing Network (MB-RACS) framework, which aims to adaptively determine the sampling rate for each image block in accordance with traditional measurement bounds theory. Moreover, since in real-world scenarios statistical information about the original image cannot be directly obtained, we suggest a multi-stage rate-adaptive sampling strategy. This strategy sequentially adjusts the sampling ratio allocation based on the information gathered from previous samplings. We formulate the multi-stage rate-adaptive sampling as a convex optimization problem and address it using a combination of Newton's method and binary search techniques. Additionally, we enhance our decoding process by incorporating skip connections between successive iterations to facilitate a richer transmission of feature information across iterations. Our experiments demonstrate that the proposed MB-RACS method surpasses current leading methods, with experimental evidence also underscoring the effectiveness of each module within our proposed framework.</p></details> |  |
| **[MsDC-DEQ-Net: Deep Equilibrium Model (DEQ) with Multi-scale Dilated Convolution for Image Compressive Sensing (CS)](http://arxiv.org/abs/2401.02884v1)** | 2024-01-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Compressive sensing (CS) is a technique that enables the recovery of sparse signals using fewer measurements than traditional sampling methods. To address the computational challenges of CS reconstruction, our objective is to develop an interpretable and concise neural network model for reconstructing natural images using CS. We achieve this by mapping one step of the iterative shrinkage thresholding algorithm (ISTA) to a deep network block, representing one iteration of ISTA. To enhance learning ability and incorporate structural diversity, we integrate aggregated residual transformations (ResNeXt) and squeeze-and-excitation (SE) mechanisms into the ISTA block. This block serves as a deep equilibrium layer, connected to a semi-tensor product network (STP-Net) for convenient sampling and providing an initial reconstruction. The resulting model, called MsDC-DEQ-Net, exhibits competitive performance compared to state-of-the-art network-based methods. It significantly reduces storage requirements compared to deep unrolling methods, using only one iteration block instead of multiple iterations. Unlike deep unrolling models, MsDC-DEQ-Net can be iteratively used, gradually improving reconstruction accuracy while considering computation trade-offs. Additionally, the model benefits from multi-scale dilated convolutions, further enhancing performance.</p></details> | <details><summary>15 pa...</summary><p>15 pages, 8 figures, open access journal paper</p></details> |
| **[Single Image Compressed Sensing MRI via a Self-Supervised Deep Denoising Approach](http://arxiv.org/abs/2311.13144v1)** | 2023-11-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Popular methods in compressed sensing (CS) are dependent on deep learning (DL), where large amounts of data are used to train non-linear reconstruction models. However, ensuring generalisability over and access to multiple datasets is challenging to realise for real-world applications. To address these concerns, this paper proposes a single image, self-supervised (SS) CS-MRI framework that enables a joint deep and sparse regularisation of CS artefacts. The approach effectively dampens structured CS artefacts, which can be difficult to remove assuming sparse reconstruction, or relying solely on the inductive biases of CNN to produce noise-free images. Image quality is thereby improved compared to either approach alone. Metrics are evaluated using Cartesian 1D masks on a brain and knee dataset, with PSNR improving by 2-4dB on average.</p></details> | <details><summary>5 pag...</summary><p>5 pages, 4 figures, 2 tables, conference</p></details> |
| **[Deep Unfolding Network for Image Compressed Sensing by Content-adaptive Gradient Updating and Deformation-invariant Non-local Modeling](http://arxiv.org/abs/2310.10033v1)** | 2023-10-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Inspired by certain optimization solvers, the deep unfolding network (DUN) has attracted much attention in recent years for image compressed sensing (CS). However, there still exist the following two issues: 1) In existing DUNs, most hyperparameters are usually content independent, which greatly limits their adaptability for different input contents. 2) In each iteration, a plain convolutional neural network is usually adopted, which weakens the perception of wider context prior and therefore depresses the expressive ability. In this paper, inspired by the traditional Proximal Gradient Descent (PGD) algorithm, a novel DUN for image compressed sensing (dubbed DUN-CSNet) is proposed to solve the above two issues. Specifically, for the first issue, a novel content adaptive gradient descent network is proposed, in which a well-designed step size generation sub-network is developed to dynamically allocate the corresponding step sizes for different textures of input image by generating a content-aware step size map, realizing a content-adaptive gradient updating. For the second issue, considering the fact that many similar patches exist in an image but have undergone a deformation, a novel deformation-invariant non-local proximal mapping network is developed, which can adaptively build the long-range dependencies between the nonlocal patches by deformation-invariant non-local modeling, leading to a wider perception on context priors. Extensive experiments manifest that the proposed DUN-CSNet outperforms existing state-of-the-art CS methods by large margins.</p></details> | <details><summary>16 pa...</summary><p>16 pages, 13 figures.

| **[Sparsity and Coefficient Permutation Based Two-Domain AMP for Image Block Compressed Sensing](http://arxiv.org/abs/2305.12986v2)** | 2023-08-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The learned denoising-based approximate message passing (LDAMP) algorithm has attracted great attention for image compressed sensing (CS) tasks. However, it has two issues: first, its global measurement model severely restricts its applicability to high-dimensional images, and its block-based measurement method exhibits obvious block artifacts; second, the denoiser in the LDAMP is too simple, and existing denoisers have limited ability in detail recovery. In this paper, to overcome the issues and develop a high-performance LDAMP method for image block compressed sensing (BCS), we propose a novel sparsity and coefficient permutation-based AMP (SCP-AMP) method consisting of the block-based sampling and the two-domain reconstruction modules. In the sampling module, SCP-AMP adopts a discrete cosine transform (DCT) based sparsity strategy to reduce the impact of the high-frequency coefficient on the reconstruction, followed by a coefficient permutation strategy to avoid block artifacts. In the reconstruction module, a two-domain AMP method with DCT domain noise correction and pixel domain denoising is proposed for iterative reconstruction. Regarding the denoiser, we proposed a multi-level deep attention network (MDANet) to enhance the texture details by employing multi-level features and multiple attention mechanisms. Extensive experiments demonstrated that the proposed SCP-AMP method achieved better reconstruction accuracy than other state-of-the-art BCS algorithms in terms of both visual perception and objective metrics.</p></details> | <details><summary>The c...</summary><p>The content modification has been upgraded and corrected on a large scale, and request to withdraw this version</p></details> |
| **[Deep Physics-Guided Unrolling Generalization for Compressed Sensing](http://arxiv.org/abs/2307.08950v1)** | 2023-07-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>By absorbing the merits of both the model- and data-driven methods, deep physics-engaged learning scheme achieves high-accuracy and interpretable image reconstruction. It has attracted growing attention and become the mainstream for inverse imaging tasks. Focusing on the image compressed sensing (CS) problem, we find the intrinsic defect of this emerging paradigm, widely implemented by deep algorithm-unrolled networks, in which more plain iterations involving real physics will bring enormous computation cost and long inference time, hindering their practical application. A novel deep $\textbf{P}$hysics-guided un$\textbf{R}$olled recovery $\textbf{L}$earning ($\textbf{PRL}$) framework is proposed by generalizing the traditional iterative recovery model from image domain (ID) to the high-dimensional feature domain (FD). A compact multiscale unrolling architecture is then developed to enhance the network capacity and keep real-time inference speeds. Taking two different perspectives of optimization and range-nullspace decomposition, instead of building an algorithm-specific unrolled network, we provide two implementations: $\textbf{PRL-PGD}$ and $\textbf{PRL-RND}$. Experiments exhibit the significant performance and efficiency leading of PRL networks over other state-of-the-art methods with a large potential for further improvement and real application to other inverse imaging problems or optimization models.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by International Journal of Computer Vision (IJCV) 2023</p></details> |
| **[NL-CS Net: Deep Learning with Non-Local Prior for Image Compressive Sensing](http://arxiv.org/abs/2305.03899v1)** | 2023-05-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Deep learning has been applied to compressive sensing (CS) of images successfully in recent years. However, existing network-based methods are often trained as the black box, in which the lack of prior knowledge is often the bottleneck for further performance improvement. To overcome this drawback, this paper proposes a novel CS method using non-local prior which combines the interpretability of the traditional optimization methods with the speed of network-based methods, called NL-CS Net. We unroll each phase from iteration of the augmented Lagrangian method solving non-local and sparse regularized optimization problem by a network. NL-CS Net is composed of the up-sampling module and the recovery module. In the up-sampling module, we use learnable up-sampling matrix instead of a predefined one. In the recovery module, patch-wise non-local network is employed to capture long-range feature correspondences. Important parameters involved (e.g. sampling matrix, nonlinear transforms, shrinkage thresholds, step size, $etc.$) are learned end-to-end, rather than hand-crafted. Furthermore, to facilitate practical implementation, orthogonal and binary constraints on the sampling matrix are simultaneously adopted. Extensive experiments on natural images and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) demonstrate that the proposed method outperforms the state-of-the-art methods while maintaining great interpretability and speed.</p></details> | 21pages,6figures |
| **[Bayesian Reconstruction of Magnetic Resonance Images using Gaussian Processes](http://arxiv.org/abs/2303.13700v1)** | 2023-03-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>A central goal of modern magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is to reduce the time required to produce high-quality images. Efforts have included hardware and software innovations such as parallel imaging, compressed sensing, and deep learning-based reconstruction. Here, we propose and demonstrate a Bayesian method to build statistical libraries of magnetic resonance (MR) images in k-space and use these libraries to identify optimal subsampling paths and reconstruction processes. Specifically, we compute a multivariate normal distribution based upon Gaussian processes using a publicly available library of T1-weighted images of healthy brains. We combine this library with physics-informed envelope functions to only retain meaningful correlations in k-space. This covariance function is then used to select a series of ring-shaped subsampling paths using Bayesian optimization such that they optimally explore space while remaining practically realizable in commercial MRI systems. Combining optimized subsampling paths found for a range of images, we compute a generalized sampling path that, when used for novel images, produces superlative structural similarity and error in comparison to previously reported reconstruction processes (i.e. 96.3% structural similarity and <0.003 normalized mean squared error from sampling only 12.5% of the k-space data). Finally, we use this reconstruction process on pathological data without retraining to show that reconstructed images are clinically useful for stroke identification.</p></details> |  |
| **[LR-CSNet: Low-Rank Deep Unfolding Network for Image Compressive Sensing](http://arxiv.org/abs/2212.09088v1)** | 2022-12-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Deep unfolding networks (DUNs) have proven to be a viable approach to compressive sensing (CS). In this work, we propose a DUN called low-rank CS network (LR-CSNet) for natural image CS. Real-world image patches are often well-represented by low-rank approximations. LR-CSNet exploits this property by adding a low-rank prior to the CS optimization task. We derive a corresponding iterative optimization procedure using variable splitting, which is then translated to a new DUN architecture. The architecture uses low-rank generation modules (LRGMs), which learn low-rank matrix factorizations, as well as gradient descent and proximal mappings (GDPMs), which are proposed to extract high-frequency features to refine image details. In addition, the deep features generated at each reconstruction stage in the DUN are transferred between stages to boost the performance. Our extensive experiments on three widely considered datasets demonstrate the promising performance of LR-CSNet compared to state-of-the-art methods in natural image CS.</p></details> |  |
| **[A Deep Learning Approach for Parallel Imaging and Compressed Sensing MRI Reconstruction](http://arxiv.org/abs/2209.08807v2)** | 2022-12-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Parallel imaging accelerates MRI data acquisition by acquiring additional sensitivity information with an array of receiver coils, resulting in fewer phase encoding steps. Because of fewer data requirements than parallel imaging, compressed sensing magnetic resonance imaging (CS-MRI) has gained popularity in the field of medical imaging. Parallel imaging and compressed sensing (CS) both reduce the amount of data captured in the k-space, which speeds up traditional MRI acquisition. As acquisition time is inversely proportional to sample count, forming an image from reduced k-space samples results in faster acquisition but with aliasing artifacts. For de-aliasing the reconstructed image, this paper proposes a novel Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) called RECGAN-GR that is supervised with multi-modal losses. In comparison to existing GAN networks, our proposed method introduces a novel generator network, RemU-Net, which is integrated with dual-domain loss functions such as weighted magnitude and phase loss functions, as well as parallel imaging-based loss, GRAPPA consistency loss. As refinement learning, a k-space correction block is proposed to make the GAN network self-resistant to generating unnecessary data, which speeds up the reconstruction process. Comprehensive results show that the proposed RECGAN-GR not only improves the PSNR by 4 dB over GAN-based methods but also by 2 dB over conventional state-of-the-art CNN methods available in the literature for single-coil data. The proposed work significantly improves image quality for low-retained data, resulting in five to ten times faster acquisition.</p></details> | 13 pages, 11 figures |
| **[JSRNN: Joint Sampling and Reconstruction Neural Networks for High Quality Image Compressed Sensing](http://arxiv.org/abs/2211.05963v1)** | 2022-11-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Most Deep Learning (DL) based Compressed Sensing (DCS) algorithms adopt a single neural network for signal reconstruction, and fail to jointly consider the influences of the sampling operation for reconstruction. In this paper, we propose unified framework, which jointly considers the sampling and reconstruction process for image compressive sensing based on well-designed cascade neural networks. Two sub-networks, which are the sampling sub-network and the reconstruction sub-network, are included in the proposed framework. In the sampling sub-network, an adaptive full connected layer instead of the traditional random matrix is used to mimic the sampling operator. In the reconstruction sub-network, a cascade network combining stacked denoising autoencoder (SDA) and convolutional neural network (CNN) is designed to reconstruct signals. The SDA is used to solve the signal mapping problem and the signals are initially reconstructed. Furthermore, CNN is used to fully recover the structure and texture features of the image to obtain better reconstruction performance. Extensive experiments show that this framework outperforms many other state-of-the-art methods, especially at low sampling rates.</p></details> | 9 pages, 3 figures |
| **[Unsupervised Learning From Incomplete Measurements for Inverse Problems](http://arxiv.org/abs/2201.12151v4)** | 2022-09-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In many real-world inverse problems, only incomplete measurement data are available for training which can pose a problem for learning a reconstruction function. Indeed, unsupervised learning using a fixed incomplete measurement process is impossible in general, as there is no information in the nullspace of the measurement operator. This limitation can be overcome by using measurements from multiple operators. While this idea has been successfully applied in various applications, a precise characterization of the conditions for learning is still lacking. In this paper, we fill this gap by presenting necessary and sufficient conditions for learning the underlying signal model needed for reconstruction which indicate the interplay between the number of distinct measurement operators, the number of measurements per operator, the dimension of the model and the dimension of the signals. Furthermore, we propose a novel and conceptually simple unsupervised learning loss which only requires access to incomplete measurement data and achieves a performance on par with supervised learning when the sufficient condition is verified. We validate our theoretical bounds and demonstrate the advantages of the proposed unsupervised loss compared to previous methods via a series of experiments on various imaging inverse problems, such as accelerated magnetic resonance imaging, compressed sensing and image inpainting.</p></details> |  |
| **[Image Compressed Sensing with Multi-scale Dilated Convolutional Neural Network](http://arxiv.org/abs/2209.13761v1)** | 2022-09-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Deep Learning (DL) based Compressed Sensing (CS) has been applied for better performance of image reconstruction than traditional CS methods. However, most existing DL methods utilize the block-by-block measurement and each measurement block is restored separately, which introduces harmful blocking effects for reconstruction. Furthermore, the neuronal receptive fields of those methods are designed to be the same size in each layer, which can only collect single-scale spatial information and has a negative impact on the reconstruction process. This paper proposes a novel framework named Multi-scale Dilated Convolution Neural Network (MsDCNN) for CS measurement and reconstruction. During the measurement period, we directly obtain all measurements from a trained measurement network, which employs fully convolutional structures and is jointly trained with the reconstruction network from the input image. It needn't be cut into blocks, which effectively avoids the block effect. During the reconstruction period, we propose the Multi-scale Feature Extraction (MFE) architecture to imitate the human visual system to capture multi-scale features from the same feature map, which enhances the image feature extraction ability of the framework and improves the performance of image reconstruction. In the MFE, there are multiple parallel convolution channels to obtain multi-scale feature information. Then the multi-scale features information is fused and the original image is reconstructed with high quality. Our experimental results show that the proposed method performs favorably against the state-of-the-art methods in terms of PSNR and SSIM.</p></details> | <details><summary>28 pa...</summary><p>28 pages, 8 figures, MsDCNN for CS</p></details> |
| **[Fast Hierarchical Deep Unfolding Network for Image Compressed Sensing](http://arxiv.org/abs/2208.01827v1)** | 2022-08-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>By integrating certain optimization solvers with deep neural network, deep unfolding network (DUN) has attracted much attention in recent years for image compressed sensing (CS). However, there still exist several issues in existing DUNs: 1) For each iteration, a simple stacked convolutional network is usually adopted, which apparently limits the expressiveness of these models. 2) Once the training is completed, most hyperparameters of existing DUNs are fixed for any input content, which significantly weakens their adaptability. In this paper, by unfolding the Fast Iterative Shrinkage-Thresholding Algorithm (FISTA), a novel fast hierarchical DUN, dubbed FHDUN, is proposed for image compressed sensing, in which a well-designed hierarchical unfolding architecture is developed to cooperatively explore richer contextual prior information in multi-scale spaces. To further enhance the adaptability, series of hyperparametric generation networks are developed in our framework to dynamically produce the corresponding optimal hyperparameters according to the input content. Furthermore, due to the accelerated policy in FISTA, the newly embedded acceleration module makes the proposed FHDUN save more than 50% of the iterative loops against recent DUNs. Extensive CS experiments manifest that the proposed FHDUN outperforms existing state-of-the-art CS methods, while maintaining fewer iterations.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by ACM MM 2022</p></details> |
| **[ICRICS: Iterative Compensation Recovery for Image Compressive Sensing](http://arxiv.org/abs/2207.09594v1)** | 2022-07-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Closed-loop architecture is widely utilized in automatic control systems and attain distinguished performance. However, classical compressive sensing systems employ open-loop architecture with separated sampling and reconstruction units. Therefore, a method of iterative compensation recovery for image compressive sensing (ICRICS) is proposed by introducing closed-loop framework into traditional compresses sensing systems. The proposed method depends on any existing approaches and upgrades their reconstruction performance by adding negative feedback structure. Theory analysis on negative feedback of compressive sensing systems is performed. An approximate mathematical proof of the effectiveness of the proposed method is also provided. Simulation experiments on more than 3 image datasets show that the proposed method is superior to 10 competition approaches in reconstruction performance. The maximum increment of average peak signal-to-noise ratio is 4.36 dB and the maximum increment of average structural similarity is 0.034 on one dataset. The proposed method based on negative feedback mechanism can efficiently correct the recovery error in the existing systems of image compressive sensing.</p></details> |  |
| **[Content-aware Scalable Deep Compressed Sensing](http://arxiv.org/abs/2207.09313v1)** | 2022-07-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>To more efficiently address image compressed sensing (CS) problems, we present a novel content-aware scalable network dubbed CASNet which collectively achieves adaptive sampling rate allocation, fine granular scalability and high-quality reconstruction. We first adopt a data-driven saliency detector to evaluate the importances of different image regions and propose a saliency-based block ratio aggregation (BRA) strategy for sampling rate allocation. A unified learnable generating matrix is then developed to produce sampling matrix of any CS ratio with an ordered structure. Being equipped with the optimization-inspired recovery subnet guided by saliency information and a multi-block training scheme preventing blocking artifacts, CASNet jointly reconstructs the image blocks sampled at various sampling rates with one single model. To accelerate training convergence and improve network robustness, we propose an SVD-based initialization scheme and a random transformation enhancement (RTE) strategy, which are extensible without introducing extra parameters. All the CASNet components can be combined and learned end-to-end. We further provide a four-stage implementation for evaluation and practical deployments. Experiments demonstrate that CASNet outperforms other CS networks by a large margin, validating the collaboration and mutual supports among its components and strategies.

As deep network approaches learn the inverse mapping directly from the CS measurements, the reconstruction speed is significantly faster than the conventional CS algorithms. However, for existing network based approaches, a CS sampling procedure has to map a separate network model. This may potentially degrade the performance of image CS with block-wise sampling because of blocking artifacts, especially when multiple sampling rates are assigned to different blocks within an image. In this paper, we develop a multichannel deep network for block-based image CS by exploiting inter-block correlation with performance significantly exceeding the current state-of-the-art methods. The significant performance improvement is attributed to block-wise approximation but full image removal of blocking artifacts. Specifically, with our multichannel structure, the image blocks with a variety of sampling rates can be reconstructed in a single model. The initially reconstructed blocks are then capable of being reassembled into a full image to improve the recovered images by unrolling a hand-designed block based CS recovery algorithm. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method outperforms the state-of-the-art CS methods by a large margin in terms of objective metrics and subjective visual image quality.

| **[Global Sensing and Measurements Reuse for Image Compressed Sensing](http://arxiv.org/abs/2206.11629v1)** | 2022-06-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recently, deep network-based image compressed sensing methods achieved high reconstruction quality and reduced computational overhead compared with traditional methods. However, existing methods obtain measurements only from partial features in the network and use them only once for image reconstruction. They ignore there are low, mid, and high-level features in the network\cite{zeiler2014visualizing} and all of them are essential for high-quality reconstruction. Moreover, using measurements only once may not be enough for extracting richer information from measurements. To address these issues, we propose a novel Measurements Reuse Convolutional Compressed Sensing Network (MR-CCSNet) which employs Global Sensing Module (GSM) to collect all level features for achieving an efficient sensing and Measurements Reuse Block (MRB) to reuse measurements multiple times on multi-scale. Finally, experimental results on three benchmark datasets show that our model can significantly outperform state-of-the-art methods.</p></details> |  |

Many optimization-inspired networks have been proposed to bring the insights of optimization algorithms into the network structure design and have achieved excellent reconstruction quality with low computational complexity. But they keep the information flow in pixel space as traditional algorithms by updating and transferring the image in pixel space, which does not fully use the information in the image features. In this paper, we propose the idea of achieving information flow phase by phase in feature space and design a Feature-Space Optimization-Inspired Network (dubbed FSOINet) to implement it by mapping both steps of proximal gradient descent algorithm from pixel space to feature space. Moreover, the sampling matrix is learned end-to-end with other network parameters. Experiments show that the proposed FSOINet outperforms the existing state-of-the-art methods by a large margin both quantitatively and qualitatively.

| **[Learning the Regularization in DCE-MR Image Reconstruction for Functional Imaging of Kidneys](http://arxiv.org/abs/2109.07548v2)** | 2021-12-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Kidney DCE-MRI aims at both qualitative assessment of kidney anatomy and quantitative assessment of kidney function by estimating the tracer kinetic (TK) model parameters. Accurate estimation of TK model parameters requires an accurate measurement of the arterial input function (AIF) with high temporal resolution. Accelerated imaging is used to achieve high temporal resolution, which yields under-sampling artifacts in the reconstructed images. Compressed sensing (CS) methods offer a variety of reconstruction options. Most commonly, sparsity of temporal differences is encouraged for regularization to reduce artifacts. Increasing regularization in CS methods removes the ambient artifacts but also over-smooths the signal temporally which reduces the parameter estimation accuracy. In this work, we propose a single image trained deep neural network to reduce MRI under-sampling artifacts without reducing the accuracy of functional imaging markers. Instead of regularizing with a penalty term in optimization, we promote regularization by generating images from a lower dimensional representation. In this manuscript we motivate and explain the lower dimensional input design. We compare our approach to CS reconstructions with multiple regularization weights. Proposed approach results in kidney biomarkers that are highly correlated with the ground truth markers estimated using the CS reconstruction which was optimized for functional analysis. At the same time, the proposed approach reduces the artifacts in the reconstructed images.</p></details> |  |
| **[Image Compressed Sensing Using Non-local Neural Network](http://arxiv.org/abs/2112.03712v1)** | 2021-12-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Deep network-based image Compressed Sensing (CS) has attracted much attention in recent years. However, the existing deep network-based CS schemes either reconstruct the target image in a block-by-block manner that leads to serious block artifacts or train the deep network as a black box that brings about limited insights of image prior knowledge. In this paper, a novel image CS framework using non-local neural network (NL-CSNet) is proposed, which utilizes the non-local self-similarity priors with deep network to improve the reconstruction quality. In the proposed NL-CSNet, two non-local subnetworks are constructed for utilizing the non-local self-similarity priors in the measurement domain and the multi-scale feature domain respectively. Specifically, in the subnetwork of measurement domain, the long-distance dependencies between the measurements of different image blocks are established for better initial reconstruction. Analogically, in the subnetwork of multi-scale feature domain, the affinities between the dense feature representations are explored in the multi-scale space for deep reconstruction. Furthermore, a novel loss function is developed to enhance the coupling between the non-local representations, which also enables an end-to-end training of NL-CSNet. Extensive experiments manifest that NL-CSNet outperforms existing state-of-the-art CS methods, while maintaining fast computational speed.</p></details> | <details><summary>14 pa...</summary><p>14 pages, 11 figures, 7 tables</p></details> |

Sparsity is an important feature to ensure robustness against noisy data, but also to find models that are interpretable and easy to analyze due to the small number of relevant terms. It is common practice to enforce sparsity by adding the $\ell_1$-norm as a weighted penalty term. In order to gain a better understanding and to allow for an informed model selection, we directly solve the corresponding multiobjective optimization problem (MOP) that arises when we minimize the main objective and the $\ell_1$-norm simultaneously. As this MOP is in general non-convex for nonlinear objectives, the weighting method will fail to provide all optimal compromises. To avoid this issue, we present a continuation method which is specifically tailored to MOPs with two objective functions one of which is the $\ell_1$-norm. Our method can be seen as a generalization of well-known homotopy methods for linear regression problems to the nonlinear case. Several numerical examples - including neural network training - demonstrate our theoretical findings and the additional insight that can be gained by this multiobjective approach.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by IEEE TPAMI 2021</p></details> |

Due to the lack of standardization in the implementation and evaluation of the proposed algorithms, the application of image compressive sensing in the real-world is limited. We believe this toolbox is the first framework that provides a unified and standardized implementation of multiple image compressive sensing algorithms. In addition, we also conduct a benchmarking study on the methods included in this framework from two aspects: reconstruction accuracy and reconstruction efficiency. We wish this toolbox and benchmark can serve the growing research community of compressive sensing and the industry applying image compressive sensing to new problems as well as developing new methods more efficiently.

To tackle these challenges, we propose a novel end-to-end flexible ISTA-unfolding deep network, dubbed ISTA-Net++, with superior performance and strong flexibility. Specifically, by developing a dynamic unfolding strategy, our model enjoys the adaptability of handling CS problems with different ratios, i.e., multi-ratio tasks, through a single model. A cross-block strategy is further utilized to reduce blocking artifacts and enhance the CS recovery quality. Furthermore, we adopt a balanced dataset for training, which brings more robustness when reconstructing images of multiple scenes. Extensive experiments on four datasets show that ISTA-Net++ achieves state-of-the-art results in terms of both quantitative metrics and visual quality. Considering its flexibility, effectiveness and practicability, our model is expected to serve as a suitable baseline in future CS research.

However, most existing deep learning methods train different models for different subsampling ratios, which brings additional hardware burden. In this paper, we develop a general framework named scalable deep compressive sensing (SDCS) for the scalable sampling and reconstruction (SSR) of all existing end-to-end-trained models. In the proposed way, images are measured and initialized linearly. Two sampling masks are introduced to flexibly control the subsampling ratios used in sampling and reconstruction, respectively. To make the reconstruction model adapt to any subsampling ratio, a training strategy dubbed scalable training is developed. In scalable training, the model is trained with the sampling matrix and the initialization matrix at various subsampling ratios by integrating different sampling matrix masks. Experimental results show that models with SDCS can achieve SSR without changing their structure while maintaining good performance, and SDCS outperforms other SSR methods.</p></details> |  |

By taking advantage of deep learning in accelerating optimization algorithms, together with the speedup strategy that using the momentum from all previous layers in the network, we propose a learning-based method, called QISTA-Net-s, to solve the sparse signal reconstruction problem. Extensive experimental comparisons demonstrate that the QISTA-Net-s yield better reconstruction qualities than state-of-the-art $\ell_1$-norm optimization (plus learning) algorithms even if the original sparse signal is noisy. On the other hand, based on the network architecture associated with QISTA, with considering the use of convolution layers, we proposed the QISTA-Net-n for solving the image CS problem, and the performance of the reconstruction still outperforms most of the state-of-the-art natural images reconstruction methods. QISTA-Net-n is designed in unfolding QISTA and adding the convolutional operator as the dictionary. This makes QISTA-Net-s interpretable. We provide complete experimental results that QISTA-Net-s and QISTA-Net-n contribute the better reconstruction performance than the competing.</p></details> |  |

Meanwhile, the group sparse coding (GSC) theory has led to great successes in image restoration (IR) problem with each group contains low-rank property. In this paper, we propose a novel low-rank minimization based denoising model for IR tasks under the perspective of GSC, an important connection between our denoising model and rank minimization problem has been put forward. To overcome the bias problem caused by convex nuclear norm minimization (NNM) for rank approximation, a more generalized and flexible rank relaxation function is employed, namely weighted nonconvex relaxation. Accordingly, an efficient iteratively-reweighted algorithm is proposed to handle the resulting minimization problem combing with the popular L_(1/2) and L_(2/3) thresholding operators. Finally, our proposed denoising model is applied to IR problems via an alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM) strategy. Typical IR experiments on image compressive sensing (CS), inpainting, deblurring and impulsive noise removal demonstrate that our proposed method can achieve significantly higher PSNR/FSIM values than many relevant state-of-the-art methods.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by Signal Processing</p></details> |
| **[The Power of Triply Complementary Priors for Image Compressive Sensing](http://arxiv.org/abs/2005.07902v1)** | 2020-05-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent works that utilized deep models have achieved superior results in various image restoration applications. Such approach is typically supervised which requires a corpus of training images with distribution similar to the images to be recovered. On the other hand, the shallow methods which are usually unsupervised remain promising performance in many inverse problems, \eg, image compressive sensing (CS), as they can effectively leverage non-local self-similarity priors of natural images. However, most of such methods are patch-based leading to the restored images with various ringing artifacts due to naive patch aggregation. Using either approach alone usually limits performance and generalizability in image restoration tasks. In this paper, we propose a joint low-rank and deep (LRD) image model, which contains a pair of triply complementary priors, namely \textit{external} and \textit{internal}, \textit{deep} and \textit{shallow}, and \textit{local} and \textit{non-local} priors. We then propose a novel hybrid plug-and-play (H-PnP) framework based on the LRD model for image CS. To make the optimization tractable, a simple yet effective algorithm is proposed to solve the proposed H-PnP based image CS problem. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that the proposed H-PnP algorithm significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art techniques for image CS recovery such as SCSNet and WNNM.</p></details> |  |

Recent algorithms combining multiple effective priors such as the sparse or low-rank models, have demonstrated superior performance in various applications. However, the relationships among the popular image models are unclear, and no theory in general is available to demonstrate their connections. In this paper, we present a theoretical analysis on the image models, to bridge the gap between applications and image prior understanding, including sparsity, group-wise sparsity, joint sparsity, and low-rankness, etc. We systematically study how effective each image model is for image restoration. Furthermore, we relate the denoising performance improvement by combining multiple models, to the image model relationships. Extensive experiments are conducted to compare the denoising results which are consistent with our analysis. On top of the model-based methods, we quantitatively demonstrate the image properties that are inexplicitly exploited by deep learning method, of which can further boost the denoising performance by combining with its complementary image models.</p></details> |  |

As a widely used surrogate function of low-rank, the nuclear norm based convex surrogate usually leads to over-shrinking problem, since the standard soft-thresholding operator shrinks all singular values equally. To improve traditional sparse representation based image compressive sensing (CS) performance, we propose a generalized CS framework based on GSR model, which leads to a nonconvex nonsmooth low-rank minimization problem. The popular L_2-norm and M-estimator are employed for standard image CS and robust CS problem to fit the data respectively. For the better approximation of the rank of group-matrix, a family of nuclear norms are employed to address the over-shrinking problem. Moreover, we also propose a flexible and effective iteratively-weighting strategy to control the weighting and contribution of each singular value. Then we develop an iteratively reweighted nuclear norm algorithm for our generalized framework via an alternating direction method of multipliers framework, namely, GSR-AIR. Experimental results demonstrate that our proposed CS framework can achieve favorable reconstruction performance compared with current state-of-the-art methods and the robust CS framework can suppress the outliers effectively.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This paper has been submitted to the Journal of the Franklin Institute. arXiv admin note: substantial text overlap with arXiv:1903.09787</p></details> |

However, when the sampling rate is low, the internal prior information of degraded images may be not enough for accurate restoration, resulting in loss of image edges and details. In this paper, we propose a joint group and residual sparse coding method for CS image recovery (JGRSC-CS). In the proposed JGRSC-CS, patch group is treated as the basic unit of sparse coding and two dictionaries (namely internal and external dictionaries) are applied to exploit the sparse representation of each group simultaneously. The internal self-adaptive dictionary is used to remove artifacts, and an external Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM) dictionary, learned from clean training images, is used to enhance details and texture. To make the proposed method effective and robust, the split Bregman method is adopted to reconstruct the whole image. Experimental results manifest the proposed JGRSC-CS algorithm outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods in both peak signal to noise ratio (PSNR) and visual quality.</p></details> | 27 pages, 7 figures |

We propose a scalable Laplacian pyramid reconstructive adversarial network (LAPRAN) that enables high-fidelity, flexible and fast CS images reconstruction. LAPRAN progressively reconstructs an image following the concept of Laplacian pyramid through multiple stages of reconstructive adversarial networks (RANs). At each pyramid level, CS measurements are fused with a contextual latent vector to generate a high-frequency image residual. Consequently, LAPRAN can produce hierarchies of reconstructed images and each with an incremental resolution and improved quality. The scalable pyramid structure of LAPRAN enables high-fidelity CS reconstruction with a flexible resolution that is adaptive to a wide range of compression ratios (CRs), which is infeasible with existing methods. Experimental results on multiple public datasets show that LAPRAN offers an average 7.47dB and 5.98dB PSNR, and an average 57.93% and 33.20% SSIM improvement compared to model-based and data-driven baselines, respectively.</p></details> | ECCV 2018 |

However, there actually exist two disadvantages with GRM in practice. One is that GRM has large memory requirement and high computational complexity, which restrict the applications of CS. Another is that the CS measurements randomly obtained by GRM cannot provide sufficient reconstruction performances. In this paper, a Deep neural network based Sparse Measurement Matrix (DSMM) is learned by the proposed convolutional network to reduce the sampling computational complexity and improve the CS reconstruction performance. Two sub networks are included in the proposed network, which are the sampling sub-network and the reconstruction sub-network. In the sampling sub-network, the sparsity and the normalization are both considered by the limitation of the storage and the computational complexity. In order to improve the CS reconstruction performance, a reconstruction sub-network are introduced to help enhance the sampling sub-network.

Specifically, we propose a novel structured deep network, dubbed ISTA-Net, which is inspired by the Iterative Shrinkage-Thresholding Algorithm (ISTA) for optimizing a general $\ell_1$ norm CS reconstruction model. To cast ISTA into deep network form, we develop an effective strategy to solve the proximal mapping associated with the sparsity-inducing regularizer using nonlinear transforms. All the parameters in ISTA-Net (\eg nonlinear transforms, shrinkage thresholds, step sizes, etc.) are learned end-to-end, rather than being hand-crafted. Moreover, considering that the residuals of natural images are more compressible, an enhanced version of ISTA-Net in the residual domain, dubbed {ISTA-Net}$^+$, is derived to further improve CS reconstruction.

However, this model usually suffers from some limits, such as dictionary learning with great computational complexity, neglecting the relationship among similar patches. In this paper, a group-based sparse representation method with non-convex regularization (GSR-NCR) for image CS reconstruction is proposed. In GSR-NCR, the local sparsity and nonlocal self-similarity of images is simultaneously considered in a unified framework. Different from the previous methods based on sparsity-promoting convex regularization, we extend the non-convex weighted Lp (0 < p < 1) penalty function on group sparse coefficients of the data matrix, rather than conventional L1-based regularization. To reduce the computational complexity, instead of learning the dictionary with a high computational complexity from natural images, we learn the principle component analysis (PCA) based dictionary for each group. Moreover, to make the proposed scheme tractable and robust, we have developed an efficient iterative shrinkage/thresholding algorithm to solve the non-convex optimization problem. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method outperforms many state-of-the-art techniques for image CS reconstruction.</p></details> |  |

Nonetheless, nuclear norm based convex surrogate of the rank function usually over-shrinks the rank components and makes different components equally, and thus may produce a result far from the optimum. To alleviate the above-mentioned limitations of the nuclear norm, in this paper we propose a new method for image restoration via the non-convex weighted Lp nuclear norm minimization (NCW-NNM), which is able to more accurately enforce the image structural sparsity and self-similarity simultaneously. To make the proposed model tractable and robust, the alternative direction multiplier method (ADMM) is adopted to solve the associated non-convex minimization problem.

However, there is not any benchmark to measure the sparsity of image patch/group because sparse discriminant conditions cannot keep unchanged. This paper analyzes the sparsity of group based on the strategy of the rank minimization. Firstly, an adaptive dictionary for each group is designed. Then, we prove that group-based sparse coding is equivalent to the rank minimization problem, and thus the sparse coefficient of each group is measured by estimating the singular values of each group. Based on that measurement, the weighted Schatten $p$-norm minimization (WSNM) has been found to be the closest solution to the real singular values of each group. Thus, WSNM can be equivalently transformed into a non-convex $\ell_p$-norm minimization problem in group-based sparse coding. To make the proposed scheme tractable and robust, the alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM) is used to solve the $\ell_p$-norm minimization problem.

Compressed sensing exploits the sparsity of images in a transform domain or dictionary to improve image recovery from undersampled measurements. In the context of inverse problems in dynamic imaging, recent research has demonstrated the promise of sparsity and low-rank techniques. For example, the patches of the underlying data are modeled as sparse in an adaptive dictionary domain, and the resulting image and dictionary estimation from undersampled measurements is called dictionary-blind compressed sensing, or the dynamic image sequence is modeled as a sum of low-rank and sparse (in some transform domain) components (L+S model) that are estimated from limited measurements. In this work, we investigate a data-adaptive extension of the L+S model, dubbed LASSI, where the temporal image sequence is decomposed into a low-rank component and a component whose spatiotemporal (3D) patches are sparse in some adaptive dictionary domain. We investigate various formulations and efficient methods for jointly estimating the underlying dynamic signal components and the spatiotemporal dictionary from limited measurements. We also obtain efficient sparsity penalized dictionary-blind compressed sensing methods as special cases of our LASSI approaches. Our numerical experiments demonstrate the promising performance of LASSI schemes for dynamic magnetic resonance image reconstruction from limited k-t space data compared to recent methods such as k-t SLR and L+S, and compared to the proposed dictionary-blind compressed sensing method.</p></details> |  |

This property has been heavily exploited in various applications in image processing and medical imaging. Compressed sensing exploits the sparsity of images or image patches in a transform domain or synthesis dictionary to reconstruct images from undersampled measurements. In this work, we focus on blind compressed sensing, where the underlying sparsifying transform is a priori unknown, and propose a framework to simultaneously reconstruct the underlying image as well as the sparsifying transform from highly undersampled measurements. The proposed block coordinate descent type algorithms involve highly efficient optimal updates. Importantly, we prove that although the proposed blind compressed sensing formulations are highly nonconvex, our algorithms are globally convergent (i.e., they converge from any initialization) to the set of critical points of the objectives defining the formulations. These critical points are guaranteed to be at least partial global and partial local minimizers. The exact point(s) of convergence may depend on initialization. We illustrate the usefulness of the proposed framework for magnetic resonance image reconstruction from highly undersampled k-space measurements. As compared to previous methods involving the synthesis dictionary model, our approach is much faster, while also providing promising reconstruction quality.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This work has been accepted for publication in the SIAM Journal on Imaging Sciences.

Slow acquisition process requires patient to be long time exposed to scanning apparatus. In recent years significant efforts are made towards the applying Compressive Sensing technique to the acquisition process of MRI and biomedical images. Compressive Sensing is an emerging theory in signal processing. It aims to reduce the amount of acquired data required for successful signal reconstruction. Reducing the amount of acquired image coefficients leads to lower acquisition time, i.e. time of exposition to the MRI apparatus. Using optimization algorithms, satisfactory image quality can be obtained from the small set of acquired samples. A number of optimization algorithms for the reconstruction of the biomedical images is proposed in the literature. In this paper, three commonly used optimization algorithms are compared and results are presented on the several MRI images.</p></details> |  |

First, it has to solve a large-scale optimization problem with high computational complexity in dictionary learning. Second, each patch is considered independently in dictionary learning and sparse coding, which ignores the relationship among patches, resulting in inaccurate sparse coding coefficients. In this paper, instead of using patch as the basic unit of sparse representation, we exploit the concept of group as the basic unit of sparse representation, which is composed of nonlocal patches with similar structures, and establish a novel sparse representation modeling of natural images, called group-based sparse representation (GSR). The proposed GSR is able to sparsely represent natural images in the domain of group, which enforces the intrinsic local sparsity and nonlocal self-similarity of images simultaneously in a unified framework. Moreover, an effective self-adaptive dictionary learning method for each group with low complexity is designed, rather than dictionary learning from natural images. To make GSR tractable and robust, a split Bregman based technique is developed to solve the proposed GSR-driven minimization problem for image restoration efficiently. Extensive experiments on image inpainting, image deblurring and image compressive sensing recovery manifest that the proposed GSR modeling outperforms many current state-of-the-art schemes in both PSNR and visual perception.</p></details> | <details><summary>34 pa...</summary><p>34 pages, 6 tables, 19 figures, to be published in IEEE Transactions on Image Processing; Project, Code and High resolution PDF version can be found: http://idm.pku.edu.cn/staff/zhangjian/. arXiv admin note: text overlap with arXiv:1404.7566</p></details> |

In this paper, we propose a new framework for image compressive sensing recovery using adaptively learned sparsifying basis via L0 minimization. The intrinsic sparsity of natural images is enforced substantially by sparsely representing overlapped image patches using the adaptively learned sparsifying basis in the form of L0 norm, greatly reducing blocking artifacts and confining the CS solution space.

| **[Using Powerful Prior Knowledge of Diffusion Model in Deep Unfolding Networks for Image Compressive Sensing](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.08429v1)** | 2025-03-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recently, Deep Unfolding Networks (DUNs) have achieved impressive reconstruction quality in the field of image Compressive Sensing (CS) by unfolding iterative optimization algorithms into neural networks. The reconstruction quality of DUNs depends on the learned prior knowledge, so introducing stronger prior knowledge can further improve reconstruction quality. On the other hand, pre-trained diffusion models contain powerful prior knowledge and have a solid theoretical foundation and strong scalability, but it requires a large number of iterative steps to achieve reconstruction. In this paper, we propose to use the powerful prior knowledge of pre-trained diffusion model in DUNs to achieve high-quality reconstruction with less steps for image CS. Specifically, we first design an iterative optimization algorithm named Diffusion Message Passing (DMP), which embeds a pre-trained diffusion model into each iteration process of DMP. Then, we deeply unfold the DMP algorithm into a neural network named DMP-DUN. The proposed DMP-DUN can use lightweight neural networks to achieve mapping from measurement data to the intermediate steps of the reverse diffusion process and directly approximate the divergence of the diffusion model, thereby further improving reconstruction efficiency. Extensive experiments show that our proposed DMP-DUN achieves state-of-the-art performance and requires at least only 2 steps to reconstruct the image. Codes are available at https://github.com/FengodChen/DMP-DUN-CVPR2025.</p></details> | CVPR2025 accepted |
| **[Invertible Diffusion Models for Compressed Sensing](http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.17006v2)** | 2025-02-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>While deep neural networks (NN) significantly advance image compressed sensing (CS) by improving reconstruction quality, the necessity of training current CS NNs from scratch constrains their effectiveness and hampers rapid deployment. Although recent methods utilize pre-trained diffusion models for image reconstruction, they struggle with slow inference and restricted adaptability to CS. To tackle these challenges, this paper proposes Invertible Diffusion Models (IDM), a novel efficient, end-to-end diffusion-based CS method. IDM repurposes a large-scale diffusion sampling process as a reconstruction model, and fine-tunes it end-to-end to recover original images directly from CS measurements, moving beyond the traditional paradigm of one-step noise estimation learning. To enable such memory-intensive end-to-end fine-tuning, we propose a novel two-level invertible design to transform both (1) multi-step sampling process and (2) noise estimation U-Net in each step into invertible networks. As a result, most intermediate features are cleared during training to reduce up to 93.8% GPU memory. In addition, we develop a set of lightweight modules to inject measurements into noise estimator to further facilitate reconstruction. Experiments demonstrate that IDM outperforms existing state-of-the-art CS networks by up to 2.64dB in PSNR. Compared to the recent diffusion-based approach DDNM, our IDM achieves up to 10.09dB PSNR gain and 14.54 times faster inference.

| **[WTDUN: Wavelet Tree-Structured Sampling and Deep Unfolding Network for Image Compressed Sensing](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.16336v1)** | 2024-11-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Deep unfolding networks have gained increasing attention in the field of compressed sensing (CS) owing to their theoretical interpretability and superior reconstruction performance. However, most existing deep unfolding methods often face the following issues: 1) they learn directly from single-channel images, leading to a simple feature representation that does not fully capture complex features; and 2) they treat various image components uniformly, ignoring the characteristics of different components. To address these issues, we propose a novel wavelet-domain deep unfolding framework named WTDUN, which operates directly on the multi-scale wavelet subbands. Our method utilizes the intrinsic sparsity and multi-scale structure of wavelet coefficients to achieve a tree-structured sampling and reconstruction, effectively capturing and highlighting the most important features within images. Specifically, the design of tree-structured reconstruction aims to capture the inter-dependencies among the multi-scale subbands, enabling the identification of both fine and coarse features, which can lead to a marked improvement in reconstruction quality. Furthermore, a wavelet domain adaptive sampling method is proposed to greatly improve the sampling capability, which is realized by assigning measurements to each wavelet subband based on its importance. Unlike pure deep learning methods that treat all components uniformly, our method introduces a targeted focus on important subbands, considering their energy and sparsity. This targeted strategy lets us capture key information more efficiently while discarding less important information, resulting in a more effective and detailed reconstruction. Extensive experimental results on various datasets validate the superior performance of our proposed method.</p></details> | <details><summary>20pag...</summary><p>20pages,Accepted by ACM Transactions on Multimedia Computing Communications and Applications (TOMM)</p></details> |
| **[Differentiable SVD based on Moore-Penrose Pseudoinverse for Inverse Imaging Problems](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.14141v1)** | 2024-11-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Low-rank regularization-based deep unrolling networks have achieved remarkable success in various inverse imaging problems (IIPs). However, the singular value decomposition (SVD) is non-differentiable when duplicated singular values occur, leading to severe numerical instability during training. In this paper, we propose a differentiable SVD based on the Moore-Penrose pseudoinverse to address this issue. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work to provide a comprehensive analysis of the differentiability of the trivial SVD. Specifically, we show that the non-differentiability of SVD is essentially due to an underdetermined system of linear equations arising in the derivation process. We utilize the Moore-Penrose pseudoinverse to solve the system, thereby proposing a differentiable SVD. A numerical stability analysis in the context of IIPs is provided. Experimental results in color image compressed sensing and dynamic MRI reconstruction show that our proposed differentiable SVD can effectively address the numerical instability issue while ensuring computational precision.

Compressive sensing (CS) has found wide-ranging applications in image acquisition and reconstruction. Recently, numerous deep-learning methods have been introduced for CS tasks. However, the accurate reconstruction of images from measurements remains a significant challenge, especially at low sampling rates. In this paper, we propose Uformer-ICS as a novel U-shaped transformer for image CS tasks by introducing inner characteristics of CS into transformer architecture. To utilize the uneven sparsity distribution of image blocks, we design an adaptive sampling architecture that allocates measurement resources based on the estimated block sparsity, allowing the compressed results to retain maximum information from the original image. Additionally, we introduce a multi-channel projection (MCP) module inspired by traditional CS optimization methods. By integrating the MCP module into the transformer blocks, we construct projection-based transformer blocks, and then form a symmetrical reconstruction model using these blocks and residual convolutional blocks. Therefore, our reconstruction model can simultaneously utilize the local features and long-range dependencies of image, and the prior projection knowledge of CS theory. Experimental results demonstrate its significantly better reconstruction performance than state-of-the-art deep learning-based CS methods.</p></details> |  |
| **[Deep Network for Image Compressed Sensing Coding Using Local Structural Sampling](http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.19111v1)** | 2024-02-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Existing image compressed sensing (CS) coding frameworks usually solve an inverse problem based on measurement coding and optimization-based image reconstruction, which still exist the following two challenges: 1) The widely used random sampling matrix, such as the Gaussian Random Matrix (GRM), usually leads to low measurement coding efficiency. 2) The optimization-based reconstruction methods generally maintain a much higher computational complexity. In this paper, we propose a new CNN based image CS coding framework using local structural sampling (dubbed CSCNet) that includes three functional modules: local structural sampling, measurement coding and Laplacian pyramid reconstruction. In the proposed framework, instead of GRM, a new local structural sampling matrix is first developed, which is able to enhance the correlation between the measurements through a local perceptual sampling strategy. Besides, the designed local structural sampling matrix can be jointly optimized with the other functional modules during training process. After sampling, the measurements with high correlations are produced, which are then coded into final bitstreams by the third-party image codec. At last, a Laplacian pyramid reconstruction network is proposed to efficiently recover the target image from the measurement domain to the image domain. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that the proposed scheme outperforms the existing state-of-the-art CS coding methods, while maintaining fast computational speed.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by ACM Transactions on Multimedia Computing Communications and Applications (TOMM)</p></details> |

A more strategic approach could be to allocate the number of measurements adaptively, based on each image block's complexity. In this paper, we propose a Measurement-Bounds-based Rate-Adaptive Image Compressed Sensing Network (MB-RACS) framework, which aims to adaptively determine the sampling rate for each image block in accordance with traditional measurement bounds theory. Moreover, since in real-world scenarios statistical information about the original image cannot be directly obtained, we suggest a multi-stage rate-adaptive sampling strategy. This strategy sequentially adjusts the sampling ratio allocation based on the information gathered from previous samplings. We formulate the multi-stage rate-adaptive sampling as a convex optimization problem and address it using a combination of Newton's method and binary search techniques. Additionally, we enhance our decoding process by incorporating skip connections between successive iterations to facilitate a richer transmission of feature information across iterations. Our experiments demonstrate that the proposed MB-RACS method surpasses current leading methods, with experimental evidence also underscoring the effectiveness of each module within our proposed framework.</p></details> |  |

To address the computational challenges of CS reconstruction, our objective is to develop an interpretable and concise neural network model for reconstructing natural images using CS. We achieve this by mapping one step of the iterative shrinkage thresholding algorithm (ISTA) to a deep network block, representing one iteration of ISTA. To enhance learning ability and incorporate structural diversity, we integrate aggregated residual transformations (ResNeXt) and squeeze-and-excitation (SE) mechanisms into the ISTA block. This block serves as a deep equilibrium layer, connected to a semi-tensor product network (STP-Net) for convenient sampling and providing an initial reconstruction. The resulting model, called MsDC-DEQ-Net, exhibits competitive performance compared to state-of-the-art network-based methods. It significantly reduces storage requirements compared to deep unrolling methods, using only one iteration block instead of multiple iterations. Unlike deep unrolling models, MsDC-DEQ-Net can be iteratively used, gradually improving reconstruction accuracy while considering computation trade-offs. Additionally, the model benefits from multi-scale dilated convolutions, further enhancing performance.</p></details> | <details><summary>15 pa...</summary><p>15 pages, 8 figures, open access journal paper</p></details> |

However, ensuring generalisability over and access to multiple datasets is challenging to realise for real-world applications. To address these concerns, this paper proposes a single image, self-supervised (SS) CS-MRI framework that enables a joint deep and sparse regularisation of CS artefacts. The approach effectively dampens structured CS artefacts, which can be difficult to remove assuming sparse reconstruction, or relying solely on the inductive biases of CNN to produce noise-free images. Image quality is thereby improved compared to either approach alone. Metrics are evaluated using Cartesian 1D masks on a brain and knee dataset, with PSNR improving by 2-4dB on average.</p></details> | <details><summary>5 pag...</summary><p>5 pages, 4 figures, 2 tables, conference</p></details> |

However, there still exist the following two issues: 1) In existing DUNs, most hyperparameters are usually content independent, which greatly limits their adaptability for different input contents. 2) In each iteration, a plain convolutional neural network is usually adopted, which weakens the perception of wider context prior and therefore depresses the expressive ability. In this paper, inspired by the traditional Proximal Gradient Descent (PGD) algorithm, a novel DUN for image compressed sensing (dubbed DUN-CSNet) is proposed to solve the above two issues. Specifically, for the first issue, a novel content adaptive gradient descent network is proposed, in which a well-designed step size generation sub-network is developed to dynamically allocate the corresponding step sizes for different textures of input image by generating a content-aware step size map, realizing a content-adaptive gradient updating. For the second issue, considering the fact that many similar patches exist in an image but have undergone a deformation, a novel deformation-invariant non-local proximal mapping network is developed, which can adaptively build the long-range dependencies between the nonlocal patches by deformation-invariant non-local modeling, leading to a wider perception on context priors. Extensive experiments manifest that the proposed DUN-CSNet outperforms existing state-of-the-art CS methods by large margins.</p></details> | <details><summary>16 pa...</summary><p>16 pages, 13 figures.

However, it has two issues: first, its global measurement model severely restricts its applicability to high-dimensional images, and its block-based measurement method exhibits obvious block artifacts; second, the denoiser in the LDAMP is too simple, and existing denoisers have limited ability in detail recovery. In this paper, to overcome the issues and develop a high-performance LDAMP method for image block compressed sensing (BCS), we propose a novel sparsity and coefficient permutation-based AMP (SCP-AMP) method consisting of the block-based sampling and the two-domain reconstruction modules. In the sampling module, SCP-AMP adopts a discrete cosine transform (DCT) based sparsity strategy to reduce the impact of the high-frequency coefficient on the reconstruction, followed by a coefficient permutation strategy to avoid block artifacts. In the reconstruction module, a two-domain AMP method with DCT domain noise correction and pixel domain denoising is proposed for iterative reconstruction. Regarding the denoiser, we proposed a multi-level deep attention network (MDANet) to enhance the texture details by employing multi-level features and multiple attention mechanisms. Extensive experiments demonstrated that the proposed SCP-AMP method achieved better reconstruction accuracy than other state-of-the-art BCS algorithms in terms of both visual perception and objective metrics.</p></details> | <details><summary>The c...</summary><p>The content modification has been upgraded and corrected on a large scale, and request to withdraw this version</p></details> |

It has attracted growing attention and become the mainstream for inverse imaging tasks. Focusing on the image compressed sensing (CS) problem, we find the intrinsic defect of this emerging paradigm, widely implemented by deep algorithm-unrolled networks, in which more plain iterations involving real physics will bring enormous computation cost and long inference time, hindering their practical application. A novel deep $\textbf{P}$hysics-guided un$\textbf{R}$olled recovery $\textbf{L}$earning ($\textbf{PRL}$) framework is proposed by generalizing the traditional iterative recovery model from image domain (ID) to the high-dimensional feature domain (FD). A compact multiscale unrolling architecture is then developed to enhance the network capacity and keep real-time inference speeds. Taking two different perspectives of optimization and range-nullspace decomposition, instead of building an algorithm-specific unrolled network, we provide two implementations: $\textbf{PRL-PGD}$ and $\textbf{PRL-RND}$. Experiments exhibit the significant performance and efficiency leading of PRL networks over other state-of-the-art methods with a large potential for further improvement and real application to other inverse imaging problems or optimization models.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by International Journal of Computer Vision (IJCV) 2023</p></details> |
| **[NL-CS Net: Deep Learning with Non-Local Prior for Image Compressive Sensing](http://arxiv.org/abs/2305.03899v1)** | 2023-05-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Deep learning has been applied to compressive sensing (CS) of images successfully in recent years. However, existing network-based methods are often trained as the black box, in which the lack of prior knowledge is often the bottleneck for further performance improvement. To overcome this drawback, this paper proposes a novel CS method using non-local prior which combines the interpretability of the traditional optimization methods with the speed of network-based methods, called NL-CS Net. We unroll each phase from iteration of the augmented Lagrangian method solving non-local and sparse regularized optimization problem by a network. NL-CS Net is composed of the up-sampling module and the recovery module. In the up-sampling module, we use learnable up-sampling matrix instead of a predefined one. In the recovery module, patch-wise non-local network is employed to capture long-range feature correspondences. Important parameters involved (e.g. sampling matrix, nonlinear transforms, shrinkage thresholds, step size, $etc.$) are learned end-to-end, rather than hand-crafted. Furthermore, to facilitate practical implementation, orthogonal and binary constraints on the sampling matrix are simultaneously adopted. Extensive experiments on natural images and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) demonstrate that the proposed method outperforms the state-of-the-art methods while maintaining great interpretability and speed.</p></details> | 21pages,6figures |
| **[Bayesian Reconstruction of Magnetic Resonance Images using Gaussian Processes](http://arxiv.org/abs/2303.13700v1)** | 2023-03-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>A central goal of modern magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is to reduce the time required to produce high-quality images. Efforts have included hardware and software innovations such as parallel imaging, compressed sensing, and deep learning-based reconstruction. Here, we propose and demonstrate a Bayesian method to build statistical libraries of magnetic resonance (MR) images in k-space and use these libraries to identify optimal subsampling paths and reconstruction processes. Specifically, we compute a multivariate normal distribution based upon Gaussian processes using a publicly available library of T1-weighted images of healthy brains. We combine this library with physics-informed envelope functions to only retain meaningful correlations in k-space. This covariance function is then used to select a series of ring-shaped subsampling paths using Bayesian optimization such that they optimally explore space while remaining practically realizable in commercial MRI systems. Combining optimized subsampling paths found for a range of images, we compute a generalized sampling path that, when used for novel images, produces superlative structural similarity and error in comparison to previously reported reconstruction processes (i.e. 96.3% structural similarity and <0.003 normalized mean squared error from sampling only 12.5% of the k-space data). Finally, we use this reconstruction process on pathological data without retraining to show that reconstructed images are clinically useful for stroke identification.</p></details> |  |

In this work, we propose a DUN called low-rank CS network (LR-CSNet) for natural image CS. Real-world image patches are often well-represented by low-rank approximations. LR-CSNet exploits this property by adding a low-rank prior to the CS optimization task. We derive a corresponding iterative optimization procedure using variable splitting, which is then translated to a new DUN architecture. The architecture uses low-rank generation modules (LRGMs), which learn low-rank matrix factorizations, as well as gradient descent and proximal mappings (GDPMs), which are proposed to extract high-frequency features to refine image details. In addition, the deep features generated at each reconstruction stage in the DUN are transferred between stages to boost the performance. Our extensive experiments on three widely considered datasets demonstrate the promising performance of LR-CSNet compared to state-of-the-art methods in natural image CS.</p></details> |  |
| **[A Deep Learning Approach for Parallel Imaging and Compressed Sensing MRI Reconstruction](http://arxiv.org/abs/2209.08807v2)** | 2022-12-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Parallel imaging accelerates MRI data acquisition by acquiring additional sensitivity information with an array of receiver coils, resulting in fewer phase encoding steps. Because of fewer data requirements than parallel imaging, compressed sensing magnetic resonance imaging (CS-MRI) has gained popularity in the field of medical imaging. Parallel imaging and compressed sensing (CS) both reduce the amount of data captured in the k-space, which speeds up traditional MRI acquisition. As acquisition time is inversely proportional to sample count, forming an image from reduced k-space samples results in faster acquisition but with aliasing artifacts. For de-aliasing the reconstructed image, this paper proposes a novel Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) called RECGAN-GR that is supervised with multi-modal losses. In comparison to existing GAN networks, our proposed method introduces a novel generator network, RemU-Net, which is integrated with dual-domain loss functions such as weighted magnitude and phase loss functions, as well as parallel imaging-based loss, GRAPPA consistency loss. As refinement learning, a k-space correction block is proposed to make the GAN network self-resistant to generating unnecessary data, which speeds up the reconstruction process. Comprehensive results show that the proposed RECGAN-GR not only improves the PSNR by 4 dB over GAN-based methods but also by 2 dB over conventional state-of-the-art CNN methods available in the literature for single-coil data.

In this paper, we propose unified framework, which jointly considers the sampling and reconstruction process for image compressive sensing based on well-designed cascade neural networks. Two sub-networks, which are the sampling sub-network and the reconstruction sub-network, are included in the proposed framework. In the sampling sub-network, an adaptive full connected layer instead of the traditional random matrix is used to mimic the sampling operator. In the reconstruction sub-network, a cascade network combining stacked denoising autoencoder (SDA) and convolutional neural network (CNN) is designed to reconstruct signals. The SDA is used to solve the signal mapping problem and the signals are initially reconstructed. Furthermore, CNN is used to fully recover the structure and texture features of the image to obtain better reconstruction performance. Extensive experiments show that this framework outperforms many other state-of-the-art methods, especially at low sampling rates.</p></details> | 9 pages, 3 figures |
| **[Unsupervised Learning From Incomplete Measurements for Inverse Problems](http://arxiv.org/abs/2201.12151v4)** | 2022-09-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In many real-world inverse problems, only incomplete measurement data are available for training which can pose a problem for learning a reconstruction function. Indeed, unsupervised learning using a fixed incomplete measurement process is impossible in general, as there is no information in the nullspace of the measurement operator. This limitation can be overcome by using measurements from multiple operators. While this idea has been successfully applied in various applications, a precise characterization of the conditions for learning is still lacking. In this paper, we fill this gap by presenting necessary and sufficient conditions for learning the underlying signal model needed for reconstruction which indicate the interplay between the number of distinct measurement operators, the number of measurements per operator, the dimension of the model and the dimension of the signals. Furthermore, we propose a novel and conceptually simple unsupervised learning loss which only requires access to incomplete measurement data and achieves a performance on par with supervised learning when the sufficient condition is verified. We validate our theoretical bounds and demonstrate the advantages of the proposed unsupervised loss compared to previous methods via a series of experiments on various imaging inverse problems, such as accelerated magnetic resonance imaging, compressed sensing and image inpainting.</p></details> |  |
| **[Image Compressed Sensing with Multi-scale Dilated Convolutional Neural Network](http://arxiv.org/abs/2209.13761v1)** | 2022-09-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Deep Learning (DL) based Compressed Sensing (CS) has been applied for better performance of image reconstruction than traditional CS methods. However, most existing DL methods utilize the block-by-block measurement and each measurement block is restored separately, which introduces harmful blocking effects for reconstruction. Furthermore, the neuronal receptive fields of those methods are designed to be the same size in each layer, which can only collect single-scale spatial information and has a negative impact on the reconstruction process. This paper proposes a novel framework named Multi-scale Dilated Convolution Neural Network (MsDCNN) for CS measurement and reconstruction. During the measurement period, we directly obtain all measurements from a trained measurement network, which employs fully convolutional structures and is jointly trained with the reconstruction network from the input image. It needn't be cut into blocks, which effectively avoids the block effect. During the reconstruction period, we propose the Multi-scale Feature Extraction (MFE) architecture to imitate the human visual system to capture multi-scale features from the same feature map, which enhances the image feature extraction ability of the framework and improves the performance of image reconstruction. In the MFE, there are multiple parallel convolution channels to obtain multi-scale feature information. Then the multi-scale features information is fused and the original image is reconstructed with high quality. Our experimental results show that the proposed method performs favorably against the state-of-the-art methods in terms of PSNR and SSIM.</p></details> | <details><summary>28 pa...</summary><p>28 pages, 8 figures, MsDCNN for CS</p></details> |
| **[Fast Hierarchical Deep Unfolding Network for Image Compressed Sensing](http://arxiv.org/abs/2208.01827v1)** | 2022-08-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>By integrating certain optimization solvers with deep neural network, deep unfolding network (DUN) has attracted much attention in recent years for image compressed sensing (CS). However, there still exist several issues in existing DUNs: 1) For each iteration, a simple stacked convolutional network is usually adopted, which apparently limits the expressiveness of these models. 2) Once the training is completed, most hyperparameters of existing DUNs are fixed for any input content, which significantly weakens their adaptability. In this paper, by unfolding the Fast Iterative Shrinkage-Thresholding Algorithm (FISTA), a novel fast hierarchical DUN, dubbed FHDUN, is proposed for image compressed sensing, in which a well-designed hierarchical unfolding architecture is developed to cooperatively explore richer contextual prior information in multi-scale spaces. To further enhance the adaptability, series of hyperparametric generation networks are developed in our framework to dynamically produce the corresponding optimal hyperparameters according to the input content. Furthermore, due to the accelerated policy in FISTA, the newly embedded acceleration module makes the proposed FHDUN save more than 50% of the iterative loops against recent DUNs. Extensive CS experiments manifest that the proposed FHDUN outperforms existing state-of-the-art CS methods, while maintaining fewer iterations.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by ACM MM 2022</p></details> |

However, classical compressive sensing systems employ open-loop architecture with separated sampling and reconstruction units. Therefore, a method of iterative compensation recovery for image compressive sensing (ICRICS) is proposed by introducing closed-loop framework into traditional compresses sensing systems. The proposed method depends on any existing approaches and upgrades their reconstruction performance by adding negative feedback structure. Theory analysis on negative feedback of compressive sensing systems is performed. An approximate mathematical proof of the effectiveness of the proposed method is also provided. Simulation experiments on more than 3 image datasets show that the proposed method is superior to 10 competition approaches in reconstruction performance. The maximum increment of average peak signal-to-noise ratio is 4.36 dB and the maximum increment of average structural similarity is 0.034 on one dataset. The proposed method based on negative feedback mechanism can efficiently correct the recovery error in the existing systems of image compressive sensing.</p></details> |  |
| **[Content-aware Scalable Deep Compressed Sensing](http://arxiv.org/abs/2207.09313v1)** | 2022-07-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>To more efficiently address image compressed sensing (CS) problems, we present a novel content-aware scalable network dubbed CASNet which collectively achieves adaptive sampling rate allocation, fine granular scalability and high-quality reconstruction. We first adopt a data-driven saliency detector to evaluate the importances of different image regions and propose a saliency-based block ratio aggregation (BRA) strategy for sampling rate allocation. A unified learnable generating matrix is then developed to produce sampling matrix of any CS ratio with an ordered structure. Being equipped with the optimization-inspired recovery subnet guided by saliency information and a multi-block training scheme preventing blocking artifacts, CASNet jointly reconstructs the image blocks sampled at various sampling rates with one single model. To accelerate training convergence and improve network robustness, we propose an SVD-based initialization scheme and a random transformation enhancement (RTE) strategy, which are extensible without introducing extra parameters. All the CASNet components can be combined and learned end-to-end. We further provide a four-stage implementation for evaluation and practical deployments. Experiments demonstrate that CASNet outperforms other CS networks by a large margin, validating the collaboration and mutual supports among its components and strategies.

| **[Multi-Channel Deep Networks for Block-Based Image Compressive Sensing](http://arxiv.org/abs/1908.11221v2)** | 2022-07-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Incorporating deep neural networks in image compressive sensing (CS) receives intensive attentions in multimedia technology and applications recently. As deep network approaches learn the inverse mapping directly from the CS measurements, the reconstruction speed is significantly faster than the conventional CS algorithms. However, for existing network based approaches, a CS sampling procedure has to map a separate network model. This may potentially degrade the performance of image CS with block-wise sampling because of blocking artifacts, especially when multiple sampling rates are assigned to different blocks within an image. In this paper, we develop a multichannel deep network for block-based image CS by exploiting inter-block correlation with performance significantly exceeding the current state-of-the-art methods. The significant performance improvement is attributed to block-wise approximation but full image removal of blocking artifacts. Specifically, with our multichannel structure, the image blocks with a variety of sampling rates can be reconstructed in a single model. The initially reconstructed blocks are then capable of being reassembled into a full image to improve the recovered images by unrolling a hand-designed block based CS recovery algorithm. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method outperforms the state-of-the-art CS methods by a large margin in terms of objective metrics and subjective visual image quality.

| **[Global Sensing and Measurements Reuse for Image Compressed Sensing](http://arxiv.org/abs/2206.11629v1)** | 2022-06-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recently, deep network-based image compressed sensing methods achieved high reconstruction quality and reduced computational overhead compared with traditional methods. However, existing methods obtain measurements only from partial features in the network and use them only once for image reconstruction. They ignore there are low, mid, and high-level features in the network\cite{zeiler2014visualizing} and all of them are essential for high-quality reconstruction. Moreover, using measurements only once may not be enough for extracting richer information from measurements. To address these issues, we propose a novel Measurements Reuse Convolutional Compressed Sensing Network (MR-CCSNet) which employs Global Sensing Module (GSM) to collect all level features for achieving an efficient sensing and Measurements Reuse Block (MRB) to reuse measurements multiple times on multi-scale. Finally, experimental results on three benchmark datasets show that our model can significantly outperform state-of-the-art methods.</p></details> |  |

Many optimization-inspired networks have been proposed to bring the insights of optimization algorithms into the network structure design and have achieved excellent reconstruction quality with low computational complexity. But they keep the information flow in pixel space as traditional algorithms by updating and transferring the image in pixel space, which does not fully use the information in the image features. In this paper, we propose the idea of achieving information flow phase by phase in feature space and design a Feature-Space Optimization-Inspired Network (dubbed FSOINet) to implement it by mapping both steps of proximal gradient descent algorithm from pixel space to feature space. Moreover, the sampling matrix is learned end-to-end with other network parameters. Experiments show that the proposed FSOINet outperforms the existing state-of-the-art methods by a large margin both quantitatively and qualitatively.

| **[Learning the Regularization in DCE-MR Image Reconstruction for Functional Imaging of Kidneys](http://arxiv.org/abs/2109.07548v2)** | 2021-12-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Kidney DCE-MRI aims at both qualitative assessment of kidney anatomy and quantitative assessment of kidney function by estimating the tracer kinetic (TK) model parameters. Accurate estimation of TK model parameters requires an accurate measurement of the arterial input function (AIF) with high temporal resolution. Accelerated imaging is used to achieve high temporal resolution, which yields under-sampling artifacts in the reconstructed images. Compressed sensing (CS) methods offer a variety of reconstruction options. Most commonly, sparsity of temporal differences is encouraged for regularization to reduce artifacts. Increasing regularization in CS methods removes the ambient artifacts but also over-smooths the signal temporally which reduces the parameter estimation accuracy. In this work, we propose a single image trained deep neural network to reduce MRI under-sampling artifacts without reducing the accuracy of functional imaging markers. Instead of regularizing with a penalty term in optimization, we promote regularization by generating images from a lower dimensional representation. In this manuscript we motivate and explain the lower dimensional input design. We compare our approach to CS reconstructions with multiple regularization weights. Proposed approach results in kidney biomarkers that are highly correlated with the ground truth markers estimated using the CS reconstruction which was optimized for functional analysis. At the same time, the proposed approach reduces the artifacts in the reconstructed images.</p></details> |  |
| **[Image Compressed Sensing Using Non-local Neural Network](http://arxiv.org/abs/2112.03712v1)** | 2021-12-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Deep network-based image Compressed Sensing (CS) has attracted much attention in recent years. However, the existing deep network-based CS schemes either reconstruct the target image in a block-by-block manner that leads to serious block artifacts or train the deep network as a black box that brings about limited insights of image prior knowledge. In this paper, a novel image CS framework using non-local neural network (NL-CSNet) is proposed, which utilizes the non-local self-similarity priors with deep network to improve the reconstruction quality. In the proposed NL-CSNet, two non-local subnetworks are constructed for utilizing the non-local self-similarity priors in the measurement domain and the multi-scale feature domain respectively. Specifically, in the subnetwork of measurement domain, the long-distance dependencies between the measurements of different image blocks are established for better initial reconstruction. Analogically, in the subnetwork of multi-scale feature domain, the affinities between the dense feature representations are explored in the multi-scale space for deep reconstruction. Furthermore, a novel loss function is developed to enhance the coupling between the non-local representations, which also enables an end-to-end training of NL-CSNet. Extensive experiments manifest that NL-CSNet outperforms existing state-of-the-art CS methods, while maintaining fast computational speed.</p></details> | <details><summary>14 pa...</summary><p>14 pages, 11 figures, 7 tables</p></details> |

Sparsity is an important feature to ensure robustness against noisy data, but also to find models that are interpretable and easy to analyze due to the small number of relevant terms. It is common practice to enforce sparsity by adding the $\ell_1$-norm as a weighted penalty term. In order to gain a better understanding and to allow for an informed model selection, we directly solve the corresponding multiobjective optimization problem (MOP) that arises when we minimize the main objective and the $\ell_1$-norm simultaneously. As this MOP is in general non-convex for nonlinear objectives, the weighting method will fail to provide all optimal compromises. To avoid this issue, we present a continuation method which is specifically tailored to MOPs with two objective functions one of which is the $\ell_1$-norm. Our method can be seen as a generalization of well-known homotopy methods for linear regression problems to the nonlinear case. Several numerical examples - including neural network training - demonstrate our theoretical findings and the additional insight that can be gained by this multiobjective approach.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by IEEE TPAMI 2021</p></details> |

We believe this toolbox is the first framework that provides a unified and standardized implementation of multiple image compressive sensing algorithms. In addition, we also conduct a benchmarking study on the methods included in this framework from two aspects: reconstruction accuracy and reconstruction efficiency. We wish this toolbox and benchmark can serve the growing research community of compressive sensing and the industry applying image compressive sensing to new problems as well as developing new methods more efficiently.

To tackle these challenges, we propose a novel end-to-end flexible ISTA-unfolding deep network, dubbed ISTA-Net++, with superior performance and strong flexibility. Specifically, by developing a dynamic unfolding strategy, our model enjoys the adaptability of handling CS problems with different ratios, i.e., multi-ratio tasks, through a single model. A cross-block strategy is further utilized to reduce blocking artifacts and enhance the CS recovery quality. Furthermore, we adopt a balanced dataset for training, which brings more robustness when reconstructing images of multiple scenes. Extensive experiments on four datasets show that ISTA-Net++ achieves state-of-the-art results in terms of both quantitative metrics and visual quality. Considering its flexibility, effectiveness and practicability, our model is expected to serve as a suitable baseline in future CS research.

However, most existing deep learning methods train different models for different subsampling ratios, which brings additional hardware burden. In this paper, we develop a general framework named scalable deep compressive sensing (SDCS) for the scalable sampling and reconstruction (SSR) of all existing end-to-end-trained models. In the proposed way, images are measured and initialized linearly. Two sampling masks are introduced to flexibly control the subsampling ratios used in sampling and reconstruction, respectively. To make the reconstruction model adapt to any subsampling ratio, a training strategy dubbed scalable training is developed. In scalable training, the model is trained with the sampling matrix and the initialization matrix at various subsampling ratios by integrating different sampling matrix masks. Experimental results show that models with SDCS can achieve SSR without changing their structure while maintaining good performance, and SDCS outperforms other SSR methods.</p></details> |  |

By taking advantage of deep learning in accelerating optimization algorithms, together with the speedup strategy that using the momentum from all previous layers in the network, we propose a learning-based method, called QISTA-Net-s, to solve the sparse signal reconstruction problem. Extensive experimental comparisons demonstrate that the QISTA-Net-s yield better reconstruction qualities than state-of-the-art $\ell_1$-norm optimization (plus learning) algorithms even if the original sparse signal is noisy. On the other hand, based on the network architecture associated with QISTA, with considering the use of convolution layers, we proposed the QISTA-Net-n for solving the image CS problem, and the performance of the reconstruction still outperforms most of the state-of-the-art natural images reconstruction methods. QISTA-Net-n is designed in unfolding QISTA and adding the convolutional operator as the dictionary. This makes QISTA-Net-s interpretable. We provide complete experimental results that QISTA-Net-s and QISTA-Net-n contribute the better reconstruction performance than the competing.</p></details> |  |

To overcome the bias problem caused by convex nuclear norm minimization (NNM) for rank approximation, a more generalized and flexible rank relaxation function is employed, namely weighted nonconvex relaxation. Accordingly, an efficient iteratively-reweighted algorithm is proposed to handle the resulting minimization problem combing with the popular L_(1/2) and L_(2/3) thresholding operators. Finally, our proposed denoising model is applied to IR problems via an alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM) strategy.

Such approach is typically supervised which requires a corpus of training images with distribution similar to the images to be recovered. On the other hand, the shallow methods which are usually unsupervised remain promising performance in many inverse problems, \eg, image compressive sensing (CS), as they can effectively leverage non-local self-similarity priors of natural images. However, most of such methods are patch-based leading to the restored images with various ringing artifacts due to naive patch aggregation. Using either approach alone usually limits performance and generalizability in image restoration tasks. In this paper, we propose a joint low-rank and deep (LRD) image model, which contains a pair of triply complementary priors, namely \textit{external} and \textit{internal}, \textit{deep} and \textit{shallow}, and \textit{local} and \textit{non-local} priors. We then propose a novel hybrid plug-and-play (H-PnP) framework based on the LRD model for image CS. To make the optimization tractable, a simple yet effective algorithm is proposed to solve the proposed H-PnP based image CS problem. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that the proposed H-PnP algorithm significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art techniques for image CS recovery such as SCSNet and WNNM.</p></details> |  |

Recent algorithms combining multiple effective priors such as the sparse or low-rank models, have demonstrated superior performance in various applications. However, the relationships among the popular image models are unclear, and no theory in general is available to demonstrate their connections. In this paper, we present a theoretical analysis on the image models, to bridge the gap between applications and image prior understanding, including sparsity, group-wise sparsity, joint sparsity, and low-rankness, etc. We systematically study how effective each image model is for image restoration. Furthermore, we relate the denoising performance improvement by combining multiple models, to the image model relationships. Extensive experiments are conducted to compare the denoising results which are consistent with our analysis. On top of the model-based methods, we quantitatively demonstrate the image properties that are inexplicitly exploited by deep learning method, of which can further boost the denoising performance by combining with its complementary image models.</p></details> |  |

As a widely used surrogate function of low-rank, the nuclear norm based convex surrogate usually leads to over-shrinking problem, since the standard soft-thresholding operator shrinks all singular values equally. To improve traditional sparse representation based image compressive sensing (CS) performance, we propose a generalized CS framework based on GSR model, which leads to a nonconvex nonsmooth low-rank minimization problem. The popular L_2-norm and M-estimator are employed for standard image CS and robust CS problem to fit the data respectively. For the better approximation of the rank of group-matrix, a family of nuclear norms are employed to address the over-shrinking problem. Moreover, we also propose a flexible and effective iteratively-weighting strategy to control the weighting and contribution of each singular value. Then we develop an iteratively reweighted nuclear norm algorithm for our generalized framework via an alternating direction method of multipliers framework, namely, GSR-AIR.

However, when the sampling rate is low, the internal prior information of degraded images may be not enough for accurate restoration, resulting in loss of image edges and details. In this paper, we propose a joint group and residual sparse coding method for CS image recovery (JGRSC-CS). In the proposed JGRSC-CS, patch group is treated as the basic unit of sparse coding and two dictionaries (namely internal and external dictionaries) are applied to exploit the sparse representation of each group simultaneously. The internal self-adaptive dictionary is used to remove artifacts, and an external Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM) dictionary, learned from clean training images, is used to enhance details and texture. To make the proposed method effective and robust, the split Bregman method is adopted to reconstruct the whole image. Experimental results manifest the proposed JGRSC-CS algorithm outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods in both peak signal to noise ratio (PSNR) and visual quality.</p></details> | 27 pages, 7 figures |

We propose a scalable Laplacian pyramid reconstructive adversarial network (LAPRAN) that enables high-fidelity, flexible and fast CS images reconstruction. LAPRAN progressively reconstructs an image following the concept of Laplacian pyramid through multiple stages of reconstructive adversarial networks (RANs). At each pyramid level, CS measurements are fused with a contextual latent vector to generate a high-frequency image residual. Consequently, LAPRAN can produce hierarchies of reconstructed images and each with an incremental resolution and improved quality. The scalable pyramid structure of LAPRAN enables high-fidelity CS reconstruction with a flexible resolution that is adaptive to a wide range of compression ratios (CRs), which is infeasible with existing methods. Experimental results on multiple public datasets show that LAPRAN offers an average 7.47dB and 5.98dB PSNR, and an average 57.93% and 33.20% SSIM improvement compared to model-based and data-driven baselines, respectively.</p></details> | ECCV 2018 |

However, there actually exist two disadvantages with GRM in practice. One is that GRM has large memory requirement and high computational complexity, which restrict the applications of CS. Another is that the CS measurements randomly obtained by GRM cannot provide sufficient reconstruction performances. In this paper, a Deep neural network based Sparse Measurement Matrix (DSMM) is learned by the proposed convolutional network to reduce the sampling computational complexity and improve the CS reconstruction performance. Two sub networks are included in the proposed network, which are the sampling sub-network and the reconstruction sub-network. In the sampling sub-network, the sparsity and the normalization are both considered by the limitation of the storage and the computational complexity. In order to improve the CS reconstruction performance, a reconstruction sub-network are introduced to help enhance the sampling sub-network.

Specifically, we propose a novel structured deep network, dubbed ISTA-Net, which is inspired by the Iterative Shrinkage-Thresholding Algorithm (ISTA) for optimizing a general $\ell_1$ norm CS reconstruction model. To cast ISTA into deep network form, we develop an effective strategy to solve the proximal mapping associated with the sparsity-inducing regularizer using nonlinear transforms. All the parameters in ISTA-Net (\eg nonlinear transforms, shrinkage thresholds, step sizes, etc.) are learned end-to-end, rather than being hand-crafted. Moreover, considering that the residuals of natural images are more compressible, an enhanced version of ISTA-Net in the residual domain, dubbed {ISTA-Net}$^+$, is derived to further improve CS reconstruction. Extensive CS experiments demonstrate that the proposed ISTA-Nets outperform existing state-of-the-art optimization-based and network-based CS methods by large margins, while maintaining fast computational speed.

| **[DR2-Net: Deep Residual Reconstruction Network for Image Compressive Sensing](http://arxiv.org/abs/1702.05743v4)** | 2017-11-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Most traditional algorithms for compressive sensing image reconstruction suffer from the intensive computation. Recently, deep learning-based reconstruction algorithms have been reported, which dramatically reduce the time complexity than iterative reconstruction algorithms. In this paper, we propose a novel \textbf{D}eep \textbf{R}esidual \textbf{R}econstruction Network (DR$^{2}$-Net) to reconstruct the image from its Compressively Sensed (CS) measurement. The DR$^{2}$-Net is proposed based on two observations: 1) linear mapping could reconstruct a high-quality preliminary image, and 2) residual learning could further improve the reconstruction quality. Accordingly, DR$^{2}$-Net consists of two components, \emph{i.e.,} linear mapping network and residual network, respectively. Specifically, the fully-connected layer in neural network implements the linear mapping network. We then expand the linear mapping network to DR$^{2}$-Net by adding several residual learning blocks to enhance the preliminary image. Extensive experiments demonstrate that the DR$^{2}$-Net outperforms traditional iterative methods and recent deep learning-based methods by large margins at measurement rates 0.01, 0.04, 0.1, and 0.25, respectively. The code of DR$^{2}$-Net has been released on: https://github.com/coldrainyht/caffe\_dr2</p></details> | Add the code link |

However, this model usually suffers from some limits, such as dictionary learning with great computational complexity, neglecting the relationship among similar patches. In this paper, a group-based sparse representation method with non-convex regularization (GSR-NCR) for image CS reconstruction is proposed. In GSR-NCR, the local sparsity and nonlocal self-similarity of images is simultaneously considered in a unified framework. Different from the previous methods based on sparsity-promoting convex regularization, we extend the non-convex weighted Lp (0 < p < 1) penalty function on group sparse coefficients of the data matrix, rather than conventional L1-based regularization. To reduce the computational complexity, instead of learning the dictionary with a high computational complexity from natural images, we learn the principle component analysis (PCA) based dictionary for each group. Moreover, to make the proposed scheme tractable and robust, we have developed an efficient iterative shrinkage/thresholding algorithm to solve the non-convex optimization problem. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method outperforms many state-of-the-art techniques for image CS reconstruction.</p></details> |  |
| **[Non-Convex Weighted Lp Nuclear Norm based ADMM Framework for Image Restoration](http://arxiv.org/abs/1704.07056v2)** | 2017-06-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Since the matrix formed by nonlocal similar patches in a natural image is of low rank, the nuclear norm minimization (NNM) has been widely used in various image processing studies. Nonetheless, nuclear norm based convex surrogate of the rank function usually over-shrinks the rank components and makes different components equally, and thus may produce a result far from the optimum. To alleviate the above-mentioned limitations of the nuclear norm, in this paper we propose a new method for image restoration via the non-convex weighted Lp nuclear norm minimization (NCW-NNM), which is able to more accurately enforce the image structural sparsity and self-similarity simultaneously. To make the proposed model tractable and robust, the alternative direction multiplier method (ADMM) is adopted to solve the associated non-convex minimization problem. Experimental results on various types of image restoration problems, including image deblurring, image inpainting and image compressive sensing (CS) recovery, demonstrate that the proposed method outperforms many current state-of-the-art methods in both the objective and the perceptual qualities.</p></details> | <details><summary>arXiv...</summary><p>arXiv admin note: text overlap with arXiv:1611.08983</p></details> |
| **[Analyzing the group sparsity based on the rank minimization methods](http://arxiv.org/abs/1611.08983v12)** | 2017-06-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Sparse coding has achieved a great success in various image processing studies. However, there is not any benchmark to measure the sparsity of image patch/group because sparse discriminant conditions cannot keep unchanged. This paper analyzes the sparsity of group based on the strategy of the rank minimization. Firstly, an adaptive dictionary for each group is designed. Then, we prove that group-based sparse coding is equivalent to the rank minimization problem, and thus the sparse coefficient of each group is measured by estimating the singular values of each group. Based on that measurement, the weighted Schatten $p$-norm minimization (WSNM) has been found to be the closest solution to the real singular values of each group. Thus, WSNM can be equivalently transformed into a non-convex $\ell_p$-norm minimization problem in group-based sparse coding. To make the proposed scheme tractable and robust, the alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM) is used to solve the $\ell_p$-norm minimization problem. Experimental results on two applications: image inpainting and image compressive sensing (CS) recovery have shown that the proposed scheme outperforms many state-of-the-art methods.</p></details> | <details><summary>arXiv...</summary><p>arXiv admin note: text overlap with arXiv:1702.04463</p></details> |
| **[Low-rank and Adaptive Sparse Signal (LASSI) Models for Highly Accelerated Dynamic Imaging](http://arxiv.org/abs/1611.04069v2)** | 2017-01-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Sparsity-based approaches have been popular in many applications in image processing and imaging. Compressed sensing exploits the sparsity of images in a transform domain or dictionary to improve image recovery from undersampled measurements. In the context of inverse problems in dynamic imaging, recent research has demonstrated the promise of sparsity and low-rank techniques. For example, the patches of the underlying data are modeled as sparse in an adaptive dictionary domain, and the resulting image and dictionary estimation from undersampled measurements is called dictionary-blind compressed sensing, or the dynamic image sequence is modeled as a sum of low-rank and sparse (in some transform domain) components (L+S model) that are estimated from limited measurements. In this work, we investigate a data-adaptive extension of the L+S model, dubbed LASSI, where the temporal image sequence is decomposed into a low-rank component and a component whose spatiotemporal (3D) patches are sparse in some adaptive dictionary domain. We investigate various formulations and efficient methods for jointly estimating the underlying dynamic signal components and the spatiotemporal dictionary from limited measurements. We also obtain efficient sparsity penalized dictionary-blind compressed sensing methods as special cases of our LASSI approaches. Our numerical experiments demonstrate the promising performance of LASSI schemes for dynamic magnetic resonance image reconstruction from limited k-t space data compared to recent methods such as k-t SLR and L+S, and compared to the proposed dictionary-blind compressed sensing method.</p></details> |  |

| **[Efficient Blind Compressed Sensing Using Sparsifying Transforms with Convergence Guarantees and Application to MRI](http://arxiv.org/abs/1501.02923v2)** | 2015-10-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Natural signals and images are well-known to be approximately sparse in transform domains such as Wavelets and DCT. This property has been heavily exploited in various applications in image processing and medical imaging. Compressed sensing exploits the sparsity of images or image patches in a transform domain or synthesis dictionary to reconstruct images from undersampled measurements. In this work, we focus on blind compressed sensing, where the underlying sparsifying transform is a priori unknown, and propose a framework to simultaneously reconstruct the underlying image as well as the sparsifying transform from highly undersampled measurements. The proposed block coordinate descent type algorithms involve highly efficient optimal updates. Importantly, we prove that although the proposed blind compressed sensing formulations are highly nonconvex, our algorithms are globally convergent (i.e., they converge from any initialization) to the set of critical points of the objectives defining the formulations. These critical points are guaranteed to be at least partial global and partial local minimizers. The exact point(s) of convergence may depend on initialization. We illustrate the usefulness of the proposed framework for magnetic resonance image reconstruction from highly undersampled k-space measurements. As compared to previous methods involving the synthesis dictionary model, our approach is much faster, while also providing promising reconstruction quality.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This work has been accepted for publication in the SIAM Journal on Imaging Sciences.

| **[Comparison of Algorithms for Compressed Sensing of Magnetic Resonance Images](http://arxiv.org/abs/1502.02182v3)** | 2015-03-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is an essential medical tool with inherently slow data acquisition process. Slow acquisition process requires patient to be long time exposed to scanning apparatus. In recent years significant efforts are made towards the applying Compressive Sensing technique to the acquisition process of MRI and biomedical images. Compressive Sensing is an emerging theory in signal processing. It aims to reduce the amount of acquired data required for successful signal reconstruction. Reducing the amount of acquired image coefficients leads to lower acquisition time, i.e. time of exposition to the MRI apparatus. Using optimization algorithms, satisfactory image quality can be obtained from the small set of acquired samples. A number of optimization algorithms for the reconstruction of the biomedical images is proposed in the literature. In this paper, three commonly used optimization algorithms are compared and results are presented on the several MRI images.</p></details> |  |
| **[Group-based Sparse Representation for Image Restoration](http://arxiv.org/abs/1405.3351v1)** | 2014-05-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Traditional patch-based sparse representation modeling of natural images usually suffer from two problems. First, it has to solve a large-scale optimization problem with high computational complexity in dictionary learning. Second, each patch is considered independently in dictionary learning and sparse coding, which ignores the relationship among patches, resulting in inaccurate sparse coding coefficients. In this paper, instead of using patch as the basic unit of sparse representation, we exploit the concept of group as the basic unit of sparse representation, which is composed of nonlocal patches with similar structures, and establish a novel sparse representation modeling of natural images, called group-based sparse representation (GSR). The proposed GSR is able to sparsely represent natural images in the domain of group, which enforces the intrinsic local sparsity and nonlocal self-similarity of images simultaneously in a unified framework. Moreover, an effective self-adaptive dictionary learning method for each group with low complexity is designed, rather than dictionary learning from natural images. To make GSR tractable and robust, a split Bregman based technique is developed to solve the proposed GSR-driven minimization problem for image restoration efficiently. Extensive experiments on image inpainting, image deblurring and image compressive sensing recovery manifest that the proposed GSR modeling outperforms many current state-of-the-art schemes in both PSNR and visual perception.</p></details> | <details><summary>34 pa...</summary><p>34 pages, 6 tables, 19 figures, to be published in IEEE Transactions on Image Processing; Project, Code and High resolution PDF version can be found: http://idm.pku.edu.cn/staff/zhangjian/. arXiv admin note: text overlap with arXiv:1404.7566</p></details> |

Most of the conventional CS recovery approaches, however, exploited a set of fixed bases (e.g. DCT, wavelet and gradient domain) for the entirety of a signal, which are irrespective of the non-stationarity of natural signals and cannot achieve high enough degree of sparsity, thus resulting in poor CS recovery performance. In this paper, we propose a new framework for image compressive sensing recovery using adaptively learned sparsifying basis via L0 minimization. The intrinsic sparsity of natural images is enforced substantially by sparsely representing overlapped image patches using the adaptively learned sparsifying basis in the form of L0 norm, greatly reducing blocking artifacts and confining the CS solution space. To make our proposed scheme tractable and robust, a split Bregman iteration based technique is developed to solve the non-convex L0 minimization problem efficiently.

However, the use of TV is not able to recover the fine details and textures, and often suffers from undesirable staircase artifact. To reduce these effects, this letter presents an improved TV based image CS recovery algorithm by introducing a new nonlocal regularization constraint into CS optimization problem. The nonlocal regularization is built on the well known nonlocal means (NLM) filtering and takes advantage of self-similarity in images, which helps to suppress the staircase effect and restore the fine details. Furthermore, an efficient augmented Lagrangian based algorithm is developed to solve the above combined TV and nonlocal regularization constrained problem. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed algorithm achieves significant performance improvements over the state-of-the-art TV based algorithm in both PSNR and visual perception.</p></details> | <details><summary>4 Pag...</summary><p>4 Pages, 1 figures, 3 tables, to be published at IEEE Int.

In contrast to traditional approaches -- which typically assume full knowledge of the forward model or access to paired degraded and ground-truth images -- the proposed method operates under minimal assumptions and relies only on small, unpaired datasets. This makes it particularly well-suited for real-world scenarios, where the forward model is often unknown or misspecified, and collecting paired data is costly or infeasible. The method leverages conditional flow matching to model the distribution of degraded observations, while simultaneously learning the forward model via a distribution-matching loss that arises naturally from the framework. Empirically, it outperforms both single-image blind and unsupervised approaches on deblurring and non-uniform point spread function (PSF) calibration tasks. It also matches state-of-the-art performance on blind super-resolution. We also showcase the effectiveness of our method with a proof of concept for lens calibration: a real-world application traditionally requiring time-consuming experiments and specialized equipment. In contrast, our approach achieves this with minimal data acquisition effort.</p></details> | <details><summary>Code ...</summary><p>Code available at https://github.com/inria-thoth/ddm4ip</p></details> |

To address these, we propose DiffRWKVIR, a novel framework unifying Test-Time Training (TTT) with efficient diffusion. Our approach introduces three key innovations: (1) Omni-Scale 2D State Evolution extends RWKV's location-dependent parameterization to hierarchical multi-directional 2D scanning, enabling global contextual awareness with linear complexity O(L); (2) Chunk-Optimized Flash Processing accelerates intra-chunk parallelism by 3.2x via contiguous chunk processing (O(LCd) complexity), reducing sequential dependencies and computational overhead; (3) Prior-Guided Efficient Diffusion extracts a compact Image Prior Representation (IPR) in only 5-20 steps, proving 45% faster training/inference than DiffIR while solving computational inefficiency in denoising. Evaluated across super-resolution and inpainting benchmarks (Set5, Set14, BSD100, Urban100, Places365), DiffRWKVIR outperforms SwinIR, HAT, and MambaIR/v2 in PSNR, SSIM, LPIPS, and efficiency metrics. Our method establishes a new paradigm for adaptive, high-efficiency image restoration with optimized hardware utilization.</p></details> | <details><summary>Submi...</summary><p>Submitted to The 8th Chinese Conference on Pattern Recognition and Computer Vision (2025).

| **[Exploiting the Exact Denoising Posterior Score in Training-Free Guidance of Diffusion Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.13614v1)** | 2025-06-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The success of diffusion models has driven interest in performing conditional sampling via training-free guidance of the denoising process to solve image restoration and other inverse problems. A popular class of methods, based on Diffusion Posterior Sampling (DPS), attempts to approximate the intractable posterior score function directly. In this work, we present a novel expression for the exact posterior score for purely denoising tasks that is tractable in terms of the unconditional score function. We leverage this result to analyze the time-dependent error in the DPS score for denoising tasks and compute step sizes on the fly to minimize the error at each time step. We demonstrate that these step sizes are transferable to related inverse problems such as colorization, random inpainting, and super resolution. Despite its simplicity, this approach is competitive with state-of-the-art techniques and enables sampling with fewer time steps than DPS.</p></details> |  |
| **[Adaptive Dropout: Unleashing Dropout across Layers for Generalizable Image Super-Resolution](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.12738v1)** | 2025-06-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Blind Super-Resolution (blind SR) aims to enhance the model's generalization ability with unknown degradation, yet it still encounters severe overfitting issues. Some previous methods inspired by dropout, which enhances generalization by regularizing features, have shown promising results in blind SR. Nevertheless, these methods focus solely on regularizing features before the final layer and overlook the need for generalization in features at intermediate layers. Without explicit regularization of features at intermediate layers, the blind SR network struggles to obtain well-generalized feature representations. However, the key challenge is that directly applying dropout to intermediate layers leads to a significant performance drop, which we attribute to the inconsistency in training-testing and across layers it introduced. Therefore, we propose Adaptive Dropout, a new regularization method for blind SR models, which mitigates the inconsistency and facilitates application across intermediate layers of networks. Specifically, for training-testing inconsistency, we re-design the form of dropout and integrate the features before and after dropout adaptively. For inconsistency in generalization requirements across different layers, we innovatively design an adaptive training strategy to strengthen feature propagation by layer-wise annealing. Experimental results show that our method outperforms all past regularization methods on both synthetic and real-world benchmark datasets, also highly effective in other image restoration tasks.

Existing text image restoration methods often fall short in hard situations, as the traditional super-resolution models cannot guarantee clarity, while diffusion-based methods fail to maintain fidelity. In this paper, we introduce a novel framework aimed at improving the generalization ability of diffusion models for text image super-resolution (SR), especially promoting fidelity. First, we propose a progressive data sampling strategy that incorporates diverse image types at different stages of training, stabilizing the convergence and improving the generalization. For the network architecture, we leverage a pre-trained SR prior to provide robust spatial reasoning capabilities, enhancing the model's ability to preserve textual information. Additionally, we employ a cross-attention mechanism to better integrate textual priors. To further reduce errors in textual priors, we utilize confidence scores to dynamically adjust the importance of textual features during training. Extensive experiments on real-world datasets demonstrate that our approach not only produces text images with more realistic visual appearances but also improves the accuracy of text structure.</p></details> |  |
| **[UniDet-D: A Unified Dynamic Spectral Attention Model for Object Detection under Adverse Weathers](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.12324v1)** | 2025-06-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Real-world object detection is a challenging task where the captured images/videos often suffer from complex degradations due to various adverse weather conditions such as rain, fog, snow, low-light, etc. Despite extensive prior efforts, most existing methods are designed for one specific type of adverse weather with constraints of poor generalization, under-utilization of visual features while handling various image degradations. Leveraging a theoretical analysis on how critical visual details are lost in adverse-weather images, we design UniDet-D, a unified framework that tackles the challenge of object detection under various adverse weather conditions, and achieves object detection and image restoration within a single network. Specifically, the proposed UniDet-D incorporates a dynamic spectral attention mechanism that adaptively emphasizes informative spectral components while suppressing irrelevant ones, enabling more robust and discriminative feature representation across various degradation types. Extensive experiments show that UniDet-D achieves superior detection accuracy across different types of adverse-weather degradation. Furthermore, UniDet-D demonstrates superior generalization towards unseen adverse weather conditions such as sandstorms and rain-fog mixtures, highlighting its great potential for real-world deployment.</p></details> |  |
| **[Efficient Visual State Space Model for Image Deblurring](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.14343v2)** | 2025-06-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and Vision Transformers (ViTs) have achieved excellent performance in image restoration. While ViTs generally outperform CNNs by effectively capturing long-range dependencies and input-specific characteristics, their computational complexity increases quadratically with image resolution. This limitation hampers their practical application in high-resolution image restoration. In this paper, we propose a simple yet effective visual state space model (EVSSM) for image deblurring, leveraging the benefits of state space models (SSMs) for visual data. In contrast to existing methods that employ several fixed-direction scanning for feature extraction, which significantly increases the computational cost, we develop an efficient visual scan block that applies various geometric transformations before each SSM-based module, capturing useful non-local information and maintaining high efficiency. In addition, to more effectively capture and represent local information, we propose an efficient discriminative frequency domain-based feedforward network (EDFFN), which can effectively estimate useful frequency information for latent clear image restoration. Extensive experimental results show that the proposed EVSSM performs favorably against state-of-the-art methods on benchmark datasets and real-world images.

| **[A Survey on All-in-One Image Restoration: Taxonomy, Evaluation and Future Trends](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.15067v2)** | 2025-06-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Image restoration (IR) aims to recover high-quality images from inputs degraded by various factors such as noise, blur, compression, and adverse weather. Traditional IR methods typically focus on specific types of degradation, which limits their effectiveness in real-world scenarios with complex distortions. In response to this challenge, the all-in-one image restoration (AiOIR) paradigm has recently emerged, offering a unified framework that adeptly addresses multiple degradation types. These innovative models enhance convenience and versatility by adaptively learning degradation-specific features while simultaneously leveraging shared knowledge across diverse corruptions. In this survey, we present the first comprehensive overview of AiOIR, offering a taxonomy that organizes existing methods by architecture innovations, learning strategies, and key improvements. We systematically categorize prevailing approaches and critically assess the challenges these models encounter, proposing future research directions to propel this rapidly evolving field. Our survey begins with an introduction to the foundational concepts of AiOIR models, followed by a categorization of typical scenarios. We then highlight key architectural and algorithmic advances in AiOIR, aiming to inspire continued innovation. To facilitate rigorous evaluation of existing methods, we collate and summarize established datasets, evaluation metrics, and common experimental settings. Finally, we present an objective comparison of open-sourced methods, providing valuable insights for researchers and practitioners. This paper stands as the first comprehensive and insightful review of all-in-one image restoration.

However, existing diffusion-based restoration methods, despite great success in natural image restoration, often struggle to faithfully reconstruct textual regions in degraded images. Those methods frequently generate plausible but incorrect text-like patterns, a phenomenon we refer to as text-image hallucination. In this paper, we introduce Text-Aware Image Restoration (TAIR), a novel restoration task that requires the simultaneous recovery of visual contents and textual fidelity. To tackle this task, we present SA-Text, a large-scale benchmark of 100K high-quality scene images densely annotated with diverse and complex text instances. Furthermore, we propose a multi-task diffusion framework, called TeReDiff, that integrates internal features from diffusion models into a text-spotting module, enabling both components to benefit from joint training. This allows for the extraction of rich text representations, which are utilized as prompts in subsequent denoising steps. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our approach consistently outperforms state-of-the-art restoration methods, achieving significant gains in text recognition accuracy.

| **[Plug-and-Play image restoration with Stochastic deNOising REgularization](http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.01779v3)** | 2025-06-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Plug-and-Play (PnP) algorithms are a class of iterative algorithms that address image inverse problems by combining a physical model and a deep neural network for regularization. Even if they produce impressive image restoration results, these algorithms rely on a non-standard use of a denoiser on images that are less and less noisy along the iterations, which contrasts with recent algorithms based on Diffusion Models (DM), where the denoiser is applied only on re-noised images. We propose a new PnP framework, called Stochastic deNOising REgularization (SNORE), which applies the denoiser only on images with noise of the adequate level. It is based on an explicit stochastic regularization, which leads to a stochastic gradient descent algorithm to solve ill-posed inverse problems. A convergence analysis of this algorithm and its annealing extension is provided. Experimentally, we prove that SNORE is competitive with respect to state-of-the-art methods on deblurring and inpainting tasks, both quantitatively and qualitatively.</p></details> |  |

With the growing demand for high-quality imaging (\textit{e.g.}, 4K and 8K), achieving a balance between restoration quality and computational efficiency has become increasingly critical. Existing methods, primarily based on CNNs, Transformers, or their hybrid approaches, apply uniform deep representation extraction across the image. However, these methods often struggle to effectively model long-range dependencies and largely overlook the spatial characteristics of image degradation (regions with richer textures tend to suffer more severe damage), making it hard to achieve the best trade-off between restoration quality and efficiency. To address these issues, we propose a novel texture-aware image restoration method, TAMambaIR, which simultaneously perceives image textures and achieves a trade-off between performance and efficiency. Specifically, we introduce a novel Texture-Aware State Space Model, which enhances texture awareness and improves efficiency by modulating the transition matrix of the state-space equation and focusing on regions with complex textures.

| **[EAM: Enhancing Anything with Diffusion Transformers for Blind Super-Resolution](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.05209v2)** | 2025-06-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Utilizing pre-trained Text-to-Image (T2I) diffusion models to guide Blind Super-Resolution (BSR) has become a predominant approach in the field. While T2I models have traditionally relied on U-Net architectures, recent advancements have demonstrated that Diffusion Transformers (DiT) achieve significantly higher performance in this domain. In this work, we introduce Enhancing Anything Model (EAM), a novel BSR method that leverages DiT and outperforms previous U-Net-based approaches. We introduce a novel block, $\Psi$-DiT, which effectively guides the DiT to enhance image restoration. This block employs a low-resolution latent as a separable flow injection control, forming a triple-flow architecture that effectively leverages the prior knowledge embedded in the pre-trained DiT. To fully exploit the prior guidance capabilities of T2I models and enhance their generalization in BSR, we introduce a progressive Masked Image Modeling strategy, which also reduces training costs. Additionally, we propose a subject-aware prompt generation strategy that employs a robust multi-modal model in an in-context learning framework. This strategy automatically identifies key image areas, provides detailed descriptions, and optimizes the utilization of T2I diffusion priors. Our experiments demonstrate that EAM achieves state-of-the-art results across multiple datasets, outperforming existing methods in both quantitative metrics and visual quality.</p></details> | <details><summary>The c...</summary><p>The company audit did not pass, there are some mistake in paper</p></details> |
| **[Adaptive Object Detection with ESRGAN-Enhanced Resolution & Faster R-CNN](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.11122v1)** | 2025-06-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In this study, proposes a method for improved object detection from the low-resolution images by integrating Enhanced Super-Resolution Generative Adversarial Networks (ESRGAN) and Faster Region-Convolutional Neural Network (Faster R-CNN). ESRGAN enhances low-quality images, restoring details and improving clarity, while Faster R-CNN performs accurate object detection on the enhanced images. The combination of these techniques ensures better detection performance, even with poor-quality inputs, offering an effective solution for applications where image resolution is in consistent. ESRGAN is employed as a pre-processing step to enhance the low-resolution input image, effectively restoring lost details and improving overall image quality. Subsequently, the enhanced image is fed into the Faster R-CNN model for accurate object detection and localization. Experimental results demonstrate that this integrated approach yields superior performance compared to traditional methods applied directly to low-resolution images. The proposed framework provides a promising solution for applications where image quality is variable or limited, enabling more robust and reliable object detection in challenging scenarios. It achieves a balance between improved image quality and efficient object detection</p></details> |  |
| **[M2Restore: Mixture-of-Experts-based Mamba-CNN Fusion Framework for All-in-One Image Restoration](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.07814v1)** | 2025-06-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Natural images are often degraded by complex, composite degradations such as rain, snow, and haze, which adversely impact downstream vision applications. While existing image restoration efforts have achieved notable success, they are still hindered by two critical challenges: limited generalization across dynamically varying degradation scenarios and a suboptimal balance between preserving local details and modeling global dependencies. To overcome these challenges, we propose M2Restore, a novel Mixture-of-Experts (MoE)-based Mamba-CNN fusion framework for efficient and robust all-in-one image restoration. M2Restore introduces three key contributions: First, to boost the model's generalization across diverse degradation conditions, we exploit a CLIP-guided MoE gating mechanism that fuses task-conditioned prompts with CLIP-derived semantic priors. This mechanism is further refined via cross-modal feature calibration, which enables precise expert selection for various degradation types. Second, to jointly capture global contextual dependencies and fine-grained local details, we design a dual-stream architecture that integrates the localized representational strength of CNNs with the long-range modeling efficiency of Mamba. This integration enables collaborative optimization of global semantic relationships and local structural fidelity, preserving global coherence while enhancing detail restoration. Third, we introduce an edge-aware dynamic gating mechanism that adaptively balances global modeling and local enhancement by reallocating computational attention to degradation-sensitive regions. This targeted focus leads to more efficient and precise restoration. Extensive experiments across multiple image restoration benchmarks validate the superiority of M2Restore in both visual quality and quantitative performance.</p></details> | <details><summary>13 pa...</summary><p>13 pages, 8 figures, 3 tables</p></details> |

In this paper, we reformulate the trajectory optimization of this kind of method, focusing on enhancing both reconstruction quality and efficiency. Initially, we navigate effective restoration paths through a reinforcement learning process, gradually steering potential trajectories toward the most precise options. Additionally, to mitigate the considerable computational burden associated with iterative sampling, we propose cost-aware trajectory distillation to streamline complex paths into several manageable steps with adaptable sizes. Moreover, we fine-tune a foundational diffusion model (FLUX) with 12B parameters by using our algorithms, producing a unified framework for handling 7 kinds of image restoration tasks. Extensive experiments showcase the $\textit{significant}$ superiority of the proposed method, achieving a maximum PSNR improvement of 2.1 dB over state-of-the-art methods, while also greatly enhancing visual perceptual quality.

However, their inherent formulation as a regression problem makes them prone to regression to the mean, limiting their ability to capture fine details, retain high-frequency information, and handle noise effectively. To address these challenges, we propose Iterative Implicit Neural Representations (I-INRs) a novel plug-and-play framework that enhances signal reconstruction through an iterative refinement process. I-INRs effectively recover high-frequency details, improve robustness to noise, and achieve superior reconstruction quality. Our framework seamlessly integrates with existing INR architectures, delivering substantial performance gains across various tasks. Extensive experiments show that I-INRs outperform baseline methods, including WIRE, SIREN, and Gauss, in diverse computer vision applications such as image restoration, image denoising, and object occupancy prediction.</p></details> |  |

However, existing approaches such as Manifold Preserving Guided Diffusion (MPGD) apply only a single gradient update per denoising step, limiting restoration fidelity and robustness, especially in embedded or out-of-distribution settings. In this work, we introduce a multistep optimization strategy within each denoising timestep, significantly enhancing image quality, perceptual accuracy, and generalization. Our experiments on super-resolution and Gaussian deblurring demonstrate that increasing the number of gradient updates per step improves LPIPS and PSNR with minimal latency overhead. Notably, we validate this approach on a Jetson Orin Nano using degraded ImageNet and a UAV dataset, showing that MPGD, originally trained on face datasets, generalizes effectively to natural and aerial scenes. Our findings highlight MPGD's potential as a lightweight, plug-and-play restoration module for real-time visual perception in embodied AI agents such as drones and mobile robots.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted in CVPR 2025 Embodied AI Workshop</p></details> |
| **[Decoupled Data Consistency with Diffusion Purification for Image Restoration](http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.06054v6)** | 2025-06-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Diffusion models have recently gained traction as a powerful class of deep generative priors, excelling in a wide range of image restoration tasks due to their exceptional ability to model data distributions. To solve image restoration problems, many existing techniques achieve data consistency by incorporating additional likelihood gradient steps into the reverse sampling process of diffusion models. However, the additional gradient steps pose a challenge for real-world practical applications as they incur a large computational overhead, thereby increasing inference time. They also present additional difficulties when using accelerated diffusion model samplers, as the number of data consistency steps is limited by the number of reverse sampling steps. In this work, we propose a novel diffusion-based image restoration solver that addresses these issues by decoupling the reverse process from the data consistency steps. Our method involves alternating between a reconstruction phase to maintain data consistency and a refinement phase that enforces the prior via diffusion purification. Our approach demonstrates versatility, making it highly adaptable for efficient problem-solving in latent space. Additionally, it reduces the necessity for numerous sampling steps through the integration of consistency models. The efficacy of our approach is validated through comprehensive experiments across various image restoration tasks, including image denoising, deblurring, inpainting, and super-resolution.</p></details> |  |
| **[RestoreGrad: Signal Restoration Using Conditional Denoising Diffusion Models with Jointly Learned Prior](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.13574v3)** | 2025-06-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Denoising diffusion probabilistic models (DDPMs) can be utilized to recover a clean signal from its degraded observation(s) by conditioning the model on the degraded signal. The degraded signals are themselves contaminated versions of the clean signals; due to this correlation, they may encompass certain useful information about the target clean data distribution. However, existing adoption of the standard Gaussian as the prior distribution in turn discards such information when shaping the prior, resulting in sub-optimal performance. In this paper, we propose to improve conditional DDPMs for signal restoration by leveraging a more informative prior that is jointly learned with the diffusion model. The proposed framework, called RestoreGrad, seamlessly integrates DDPMs into the variational autoencoder (VAE) framework, taking advantage of the correlation between the degraded and clean signals to encode a better diffusion prior. On speech and image restoration tasks, we show that RestoreGrad demonstrates faster convergence (5-10 times fewer training steps) to achieve better quality of restored signals over existing DDPM baselines and improved robustness to using fewer sampling steps in inference time (2-2.5 times fewer), advocating the advantages of leveraging jointly learned prior for efficiency improvements in the diffusion process.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by ICML 2025 - Camera Ready Version</p></details> |

However, these approaches frequently produce blurred or excessively smoothed image details and lack a comprehensive theoretical foundation to explain these shortcomings. To address these limitations, we propose UniDB, a unified framework for diffusion bridges based on Stochastic Optimal Control (SOC). UniDB formulates the problem through an SOC-based optimization and derives a closed-form solution for the optimal controller, thereby unifying and generalizing existing diffusion bridge models. We demonstrate that existing diffusion bridges employing Doob's $h$-transform constitute a special case of our framework, emerging when the terminal penalty coefficient in the SOC cost function tends to infinity. By incorporating a tunable terminal penalty coefficient, UniDB achieves an optimal balance between control costs and terminal penalties, substantially improving detail preservation and output quality. Notably, UniDB seamlessly integrates with existing diffusion bridge models, requiring only minimal code modifications. Extensive experiments across diverse image restoration tasks validate the superiority and adaptability of the proposed framework.

Existing works make improvements through simulating those degradations and leveraging image generative priors, however generalization to in-the-wild data remains an unresolved problem. In this paper, we focus on complex degradations, i.e., arbitrary mixtures of multiple types of known degradations, which is frequently seen in the wild. A simple yet flexible diffusionbased framework, named UniRes, is proposed to address such degradations in an end-to-end manner. It combines several specialized models during the diffusion sampling steps, hence transferring the knowledge from several well-isolated restoration tasks to the restoration of complex in-the-wild degradations. This only requires well-isolated training data for several degradation types. The framework is flexible as extensions can be added through a unified formulation, and the fidelity-quality trade-off can be adjusted through a new paradigm. Our proposed method is evaluated on both complex-degradation and single-degradation image restoration datasets. Extensive qualitative and quantitative experimental results show consistent performance gain especially for images with complex degradations.</p></details> |  |
| **[SeedVR2: One-Step Video Restoration via Diffusion Adversarial Post-Training](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.05301v1)** | 2025-06-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent advances in diffusion-based video restoration (VR) demonstrate significant improvement in visual quality, yet yield a prohibitive computational cost during inference. While several distillation-based approaches have exhibited the potential of one-step image restoration, extending existing approaches to VR remains challenging and underexplored, particularly when dealing with high-resolution video in real-world settings. In this work, we propose a one-step diffusion-based VR model, termed as SeedVR2, which performs adversarial VR training against real data. To handle the challenging high-resolution VR within a single step, we introduce several enhancements to both model architecture and training procedures. Specifically, an adaptive window attention mechanism is proposed, where the window size is dynamically adjusted to fit the output resolutions, avoiding window inconsistency observed under high-resolution VR using window attention with a predefined window size. To stabilize and improve the adversarial post-training towards VR, we further verify the effectiveness of a series of losses, including a proposed feature matching loss without significantly sacrificing training efficiency. Extensive experiments show that SeedVR2 can achieve comparable or even better performance compared with existing VR approaches in a single step.</p></details> | <details><summary>Draft...</summary><p>Draft Ver.

However, accelerated acquisition often degrades image quality, impairing the visibility of fine anatomical details and potentially compromising diagnosis. To overcome this limitation, we introduce the first application of SAM-based semantic priors for medical image restoration, utilizing the Segment Anything Model (SAM) to enhance pediatric rapid bone scintigraphy. Our approach employs two cascaded networks, $f^{IR1}$ and $f^{IR2}$, supported by three specialized modules: a Semantic Prior Integration (SPI) module, a Semantic Knowledge Distillation (SKD) module, and a Semantic Consistency Module (SCM). The SPI and SKD modules inject domain-specific semantic cues from a fine-tuned SAM, while the SCM preserves coherent semantic feature representations across both cascaded stages. Moreover, we present RBS, a novel Rapid Bone Scintigraphy dataset comprising paired standard (20 cm/min) and rapid (40 cm/min) scans from 137 pediatric patients aged 0.5 - 16 years, making it the first dataset tailored for pediatric rapid bone scintigraphy restoration. Extensive experiments on both a public endoscopic dataset and our RBS dataset demonstrate that our method consistently surpasses existing techniques in PSNR, SSIM, FID, and LPIPS metrics.</p></details> | <details><summary>12 pa...</summary><p>12 pages, 9 figures, 8 tables</p></details> |

By integrating the Mamba network architecture with the diffusion model, the condition network achieves refined conditional control, thereby enhancing the control and optimization of the image generation process. To evaluate the robustness and generalization capability of our method across various image degradation conditions, extensive experiments were conducted on several benchmark datasets, including Rain100H, Rain100L, GoPro, and SSID.

Notably, ablation experiments reveal that directly noise prediction in the diffusion process achieves better performance, effectively balancing noise suppression and detail preservation. Furthermore, the findings indicate that the Mamba architecture is particularly well-suited as a conditional control network for diffusion models, outperforming both CNN- and Attention-based approaches in this context. Overall, these results highlight the flexibility and effectiveness of ControlMambaIR in addressing a range of image restoration perceptual challenges.</p></details> |  |

Moreover, the noise level in these samples approximates their distance to the underlying manifold. Building on this insight, we propose a novel method to enhance sample generation by aligning the estimated noise level with the true distance of noisy samples to the manifold. Specifically, we introduce a noise level correction network, leveraging a pre-trained denoising network, to refine noise level estimates during the denoising process. Additionally, we extend this approach to various image restoration tasks by integrating task-specific constraints, including inpainting, deblurring, super-resolution, colorization, and compressed sensing. Experimental results demonstrate that our method significantly improves sample quality in both unconstrained and constrained generation scenarios. Notably, the proposed noise level correction framework is compatible with existing denoising schedulers (e.g., DDIM), offering additional performance improvements.</p></details> |  |

Perceptual Image Restoration (PIR) methods improve visual quality but often do not support downstream tasks effectively. On the other hand, Task-oriented Image Restoration (TIR) methods focus on enhancing image utility for high-level vision tasks, sometimes compromising visual quality. This paper introduces UniRestore, a unified image restoration model that bridges the gap between PIR and TIR by using a diffusion prior. The diffusion prior is designed to generate images that align with human visual quality preferences, but these images are often unsuitable for TIR scenarios. To solve this limitation, UniRestore utilizes encoder features from an autoencoder to adapt the diffusion prior to specific tasks. We propose a Complementary Feature Restoration Module (CFRM) to reconstruct degraded encoder features and a Task Feature Adapter (TFA) module to facilitate adaptive feature fusion in the decoder. This design allows UniRestore to optimize images for both human perception and downstream task requirements, addressing discrepancies between visual quality and functional needs. Integrating these modules also enhances UniRestore's adapability and efficiency across diverse tasks. Extensive expertments demonstrate the superior performance of UniRestore in both PIR and TIR scenarios.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by CVPR2025 (Highlight); Project Page: https://unirestore.github.io</p></details> |

Given the iterative refinement nature of diffusion models, most existing approaches are computationally expensive. While methods such as SinSR and OSEDiff have emerged to condense inference steps via distillation, their performance in image restoration or details recovery is not satisfied. To address this, we propose TSD-SR, a novel distillation framework specifically designed for real-world image super-resolution, aiming to construct an efficient and effective one-step model. We first introduce the Target Score Distillation, which leverages the priors of diffusion models and real image references to achieve more realistic image restoration. Secondly, we propose a Distribution-Aware Sampling Module to make detail-oriented gradients more readily accessible, addressing the challenge of recovering fine details. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our TSD-SR has superior restoration results (most of the metrics perform the best) and the fastest inference speed (e.g. 40 times faster than SeeSR) compared to the past Real-ISR approaches based on pre-trained diffusion priors.</p></details> |  |
| **[Image Restoration Learning via Noisy Supervision in the Fourier Domain](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.00564v1)** | 2025-05-31 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Noisy supervision refers to supervising image restoration learning with noisy targets. It can alleviate the data collection burden and enhance the practical applicability of deep learning techniques. However, existing methods suffer from two key drawbacks. Firstly, they are ineffective in handling spatially correlated noise commonly observed in practical applications such as low-light imaging and remote sensing. Secondly, they rely on pixel-wise loss functions that only provide limited supervision information. This work addresses these challenges by leveraging the Fourier domain. We highlight that the Fourier coefficients of spatially correlated noise exhibit sparsity and independence, making them easier to handle. Additionally, Fourier coefficients contain global information, enabling more significant supervision. Motivated by these insights, we propose to establish noisy supervision in the Fourier domain. We first prove that Fourier coefficients of a wide range of noise converge in distribution to the Gaussian distribution. Exploiting this statistical property, we establish the equivalence between using noisy targets and clean targets in the Fourier domain. This leads to a unified learning framework applicable to various image restoration tasks, diverse network architectures, and different noise models. Extensive experiments validate the outstanding performance of this framework in terms of both quantitative indices and perceptual quality.</p></details> |  |
| **[IRBridge: Solving Image Restoration Bridge with Pre-trained Generative Diffusion Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.24406v1)** | 2025-05-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Bridge models in image restoration construct a diffusion process from degraded to clear images. However, existing methods typically require training a bridge model from scratch for each specific type of degradation, resulting in high computational costs and limited performance. This work aims to efficiently leverage pretrained generative priors within existing image restoration bridges to eliminate this requirement. The main challenge is that standard generative models are typically designed for a diffusion process that starts from pure noise, while restoration tasks begin with a low-quality image, resulting in a mismatch in the state distributions between the two processes. To address this challenge, we propose a transition equation that bridges two diffusion processes with the same endpoint distribution. Based on this, we introduce the IRBridge framework, which enables the direct utilization of generative models within image restoration bridges, offering a more flexible and adaptable approach to image restoration. Extensive experiments on six image restoration tasks demonstrate that IRBridge efficiently integrates generative priors, resulting in improved robustness and generalization performance. Code will be available at GitHub.</p></details> |  |
| **[Boosting All-in-One Image Restoration via Self-Improved Privilege Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.24207v1)** | 2025-05-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Unified image restoration models for diverse and mixed degradations often suffer from unstable optimization dynamics and inter-task conflicts. This paper introduces Self-Improved Privilege Learning (SIPL), a novel paradigm that overcomes these limitations by innovatively extending the utility of privileged information (PI) beyond training into the inference stage. Unlike conventional Privilege Learning, where ground-truth-derived guidance is typically discarded after training, SIPL empowers the model to leverage its own preliminary outputs as pseudo-privileged signals for iterative self-refinement at test time. Central to SIPL is Proxy Fusion, a lightweight module incorporating a learnable Privileged Dictionary. During training, this dictionary distills essential high-frequency and structural priors from privileged feature representations. Critically, at inference, the same learned dictionary then interacts with features derived from the model's initial restoration, facilitating a self-correction loop. SIPL can be seamlessly integrated into various backbone architectures, offering substantial performance improvements with minimal computational overhead. Extensive experiments demonstrate that SIPL significantly advances the state-of-the-art on diverse all-in-one image restoration benchmarks. For instance, when integrated with the PromptIR model, SIPL achieves remarkable PSNR improvements of +4.58 dB on composite degradation tasks and +1.28 dB on diverse five-task benchmarks, underscoring its effectiveness and broad applicability.

| **[Cross-Modal Causal Intervention for Medical Report Generation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2303.09117v5)** | 2025-05-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Radiology Report Generation (RRG) is essential for computer-aided diagnosis and medication guidance, which can relieve the heavy burden of radiologists by automatically generating the corresponding radiology reports according to the given radiology image. However, generating accurate lesion descriptions remains challenging due to spurious correlations from visual-linguistic biases and inherent limitations of radiological imaging, such as low resolution and noise interference. To address these issues, we propose a two-stage framework named CrossModal Causal Representation Learning (CMCRL), consisting of the Radiological Cross-modal Alignment and Reconstruction Enhanced (RadCARE) pre-training and the Visual-Linguistic Causal Intervention (VLCI) fine-tuning. In the pre-training stage, RadCARE introduces a degradation-aware masked image restoration strategy tailored for radiological images, which reconstructs high-resolution patches from low-resolution inputs to mitigate noise and detail loss. Combined with a multiway architecture and four adaptive training strategies (e.g., text postfix generation with degraded images and text prefixes), RadCARE establishes robust cross-modal correlations even with incomplete data. In the VLCI phase, we deploy causal front-door intervention through two modules: the Visual Deconfounding Module (VDM) disentangles local-global features without fine-grained annotations, while the Linguistic Deconfounding Module (LDM) eliminates context bias without external terminology databases. Experiments on IU-Xray and MIMIC-CXR show that our CMCRL pipeline significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods, with ablation studies confirming the necessity of both stages. Code and models are available at https://github.com/WissingChen/CMCRL.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by IEEE TIP 2025, 16 pages, 11 figures, 7 tables</p></details> |
| **[Proximal Algorithm Unrolling: Flexible and Efficient Reconstruction Networks for Single-Pixel Imaging](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.23180v1)** | 2025-05-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Deep-unrolling and plug-and-play (PnP) approaches have become the de-facto standard solvers for single-pixel imaging (SPI) inverse problem. PnP approaches, a class of iterative algorithms where regularization is implicitly performed by an off-the-shelf deep denoiser, are flexible for varying compression ratios (CRs) but are limited in reconstruction accuracy and speed. Conversely, unrolling approaches, a class of multi-stage neural networks where a truncated iterative optimization process is transformed into an end-to-end trainable network, typically achieve better accuracy with faster inference but require fine-tuning or even retraining when CR changes. In this paper, we address the challenge of integrating the strengths of both classes of solvers. To this end, we design an efficient deep image restorer (DIR) for the unrolling of HQS (half quadratic splitting) and ADMM (alternating direction method of multipliers). More importantly, a general proximal trajectory (PT) loss function is proposed to train HQS/ADMM-unrolling networks such that learned DIR approximates the proximal operator of an ideal explicit restoration regularizer. Extensive experiments demonstrate that, the resulting proximal unrolling networks can not only flexibly handle varying CRs with a single model like PnP algorithms, but also outperform previous CR-specific unrolling networks in both reconstruction accuracy and speed.

To address these challenges, we introduce a Unified Receptance Weighted Key Value (URWKV) model with multi-state perspective, enabling flexible and effective degradation restoration for low-light images. Specifically, we customize the core URWKV block to perceive and analyze complex degradations by leveraging multiple intra- and inter-stage states. First, inspired by the pupil mechanism in the human visual system, we propose Luminance-adaptive Normalization (LAN) that adjusts normalization parameters based on rich inter-stage states, allowing for adaptive, scene-aware luminance modulation. Second, we aggregate multiple intra-stage states through exponential moving average approach, effectively capturing subtle variations while mitigating information loss inherent in the single-state mechanism. To reduce the degradation effects commonly associated with conventional skip connections, we propose the State-aware Selective Fusion (SSF) module, which dynamically aligns and integrates multi-state features across encoder stages, selectively fusing contextual information. In comparison to state-of-the-art models, our URWKV model achieves superior performance on various benchmarks, while requiring significantly fewer parameters and computational resources.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This paper has been accepted to CVPR 2025</p></details> |
| **[EquiReg: Equivariance Regularized Diffusion for Inverse Problems](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.22973v1)** | 2025-05-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Diffusion models represent the state-of-the-art for solving inverse problems such as image restoration tasks. In the Bayesian framework, diffusion-based inverse solvers incorporate a likelihood term to guide the prior sampling process, generating data consistent with the posterior distribution. However, due to the intractability of the likelihood term, many current methods rely on isotropic Gaussian approximations, which lead to deviations from the data manifold and result in inconsistent, unstable reconstructions. We propose Equivariance Regularized (EquiReg) diffusion, a general framework for regularizing posterior sampling in diffusion-based inverse problem solvers. EquiReg enhances reconstructions by reweighting diffusion trajectories and penalizing those that deviate from the data manifold. We define a new distribution-dependent equivariance error, empirically identify functions that exhibit low error for on-manifold samples and higher error for off-manifold samples, and leverage these functions to regularize the diffusion sampling process. When applied to a variety of solvers, EquiReg outperforms state-of-the-art diffusion models in both linear and nonlinear image restoration tasks, as well as in reconstructing partial differential equations.</p></details> |  |
| **[From Controlled Scenarios to Real-World: Cross-Domain Degradation Pattern Matching for All-in-One Image Restoration](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.22284v1)** | 2025-05-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>As a fundamental imaging task, All-in-One Image Restoration (AiOIR) aims to achieve image restoration caused by multiple degradation patterns via a single model with unified parameters. Although existing AiOIR approaches obtain promising performance in closed and controlled scenarios, they still suffered from considerable performance reduction in real-world scenarios since the gap of data distributions between the training samples (source domain) and real-world test samples (target domain) can lead inferior degradation awareness ability. To address this issue, a Unified Domain-Adaptive Image Restoration (UDAIR) framework is proposed to effectively achieve AiOIR by leveraging the learned knowledge from source domain to target domain. To improve the degradation identification, a codebook is designed to learn a group of discrete embeddings to denote the degradation patterns, and the cross-sample contrastive learning mechanism is further proposed to capture shared features from different samples of certain degradation. To bridge the data gap, a domain adaptation strategy is proposed to build the feature projection between the source and target domains by dynamically aligning their codebook embeddings, and a correlation alignment-based test-time adaptation mechanism is designed to fine-tune the alignment discrepancies by tightening the degradation embeddings to the corresponding cluster center in the source domain. Experimental results on 10 open-source datasets demonstrate that UDAIR achieves new state-of-the-art performance for the AiOIR task. Most importantly, the feature cluster validate the degradation identification under unknown conditions, and qualitative comparisons showcase robust generalization to real-world scenarios.</p></details> |  |

First, we synthesize document-image pairs from plaintext, rendering them with diverse fonts and layouts and then applying a randomly ordered set of degradation operations. An image restoration model is trained on this synthetic data, using multi-directional patch extraction and fusion to process large images. Second, a ByT5 post-OCR model, fine-tuned on synthetic historical text pairs, addresses remaining OCR errors. Detailed experiments on 13,831 pages of real historical documents in English, French, and Spanish show that the PreP-OCR pipeline reduces character error rates by 63.9-70.3% compared to OCR on raw images. Our pipeline demonstrates the potential of integrating image restoration with linguistic error correction for digitizing historical archives.</p></details> | ACL 2025 main |
| **[Reference-Guided Identity Preserving Face Restoration](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.21905v1)** | 2025-05-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Preserving face identity is a critical yet persistent challenge in diffusion-based image restoration. While reference faces offer a path forward, existing reference-based methods often fail to fully exploit their potential. This paper introduces a novel approach that maximizes reference face utility for improved face restoration and identity preservation. Our method makes three key contributions: 1) Composite Context, a comprehensive representation that fuses multi-level (high- and low-level) information from the reference face, offering richer guidance than prior singular representations. 2) Hard Example Identity Loss, a novel loss function that leverages the reference face to address the identity learning inefficiencies found in the existing identity loss. 3) A training-free method to adapt the model to multi-reference inputs during inference. The proposed method demonstrably restores high-quality faces and achieves state-of-the-art identity preserving restoration on benchmarks such as FFHQ-Ref and CelebA-Ref-Test, consistently outperforming previous work.</p></details> |  |
| **[BaryIR: Learning Multi-Source Unified Representation in Continuous Barycenter Space for Generalizable All-in-One Image Restoration](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.21637v1)** | 2025-05-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Despite remarkable advances made in all-in-one image restoration (AIR) for handling different types of degradations simultaneously, existing methods remain vulnerable to out-of-distribution degradations and images, limiting their real-world applicability. In this paper, we propose a multi-source representation learning framework BaryIR, which decomposes the latent space of multi-source degraded images into a continuous barycenter space for unified feature encoding and source-specific subspaces for specific semantic encoding. Specifically, we seek the multi-source unified representation by introducing a multi-source latent optimal transport barycenter problem, in which a continuous barycenter map is learned to transport the latent representations to the barycenter space. The transport cost is designed such that the representations from source-specific subspaces are contrasted with each other while maintaining orthogonality to those from the barycenter space. This enables BaryIR to learn compact representations with unified degradation-agnostic information from the barycenter space, as well as degradation-specific semantics from source-specific subspaces, capturing the inherent geometry of multi-source data manifold for generalizable AIR. Extensive experiments demonstrate that BaryIR achieves competitive performance compared to state-of-the-art all-in-one methods. Particularly, BaryIR exhibits superior generalization ability to real-world data and unseen degradations. The code will be publicly available at https://github.com/xl-tang3/BaryIR.</p></details> |  |
| **[A Regularization-Guided Equivariant Approach for Image Restoration](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.19799v1)** | 2025-05-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Equivariant and invariant deep learning models have been developed to exploit intrinsic symmetries in data, demonstrating significant effectiveness in certain scenarios. However, these methods often suffer from limited representation accuracy and rely on strict symmetry assumptions that may not hold in practice. These limitations pose a significant drawback for image restoration tasks, which demands high accuracy and precise symmetry representation. To address these challenges, we propose a rotation-equivariant regularization strategy that adaptively enforces the appropriate symmetry constraints on the data while preserving the network's representational accuracy. Specifically, we introduce EQ-Reg, a regularizer designed to enhance rotation equivariance, which innovatively extends the insights of data-augmentation-based and equivariant-based methodologies. This is achieved through self-supervised learning and the spatial rotation and cyclic channel shift of feature maps deduce in the equivariant framework. Our approach firstly enables a non-strictly equivariant network suitable for image restoration, providing a simple and adaptive mechanism for adjusting equivariance based on task. Extensive experiments across three low-level tasks demonstrate the superior accuracy and generalization capability of our method, outperforming state-of-the-art approaches.</p></details> |  |
| **[HPPP: Halpern-type Preconditioned Proximal Point Algorithms and Applications to Image Restoration](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.13120v4)** | 2025-05-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recently, the degenerate preconditioned proximal point (PPP) method provides a unified and flexible framework for designing and analyzing operator-splitting algorithms such as Douglas-Rachford (DR). However, the degenerate PPP method exhibits weak convergence in the infinite-dimensional Hilbert space and lacks accelerated variants. To address these issues, we propose a Halpern-type PPP (HPPP) algorithm, which leverages the strong convergence and acceleration properties of Halpern's iteration method. Moreover, we propose a novel algorithm for image restoration by combining HPPP with denoiser priors such as Plug-and-Play (PnP) prior, which can be viewed as an accelerated PnP method. Finally, numerical experiments including several toy examples and image restoration validate the effectiveness of our proposed algorithms.</p></details> |  |
| **[Benchmarking Laparoscopic Surgical Image Restoration and Beyond](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.19161v1)** | 2025-05-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In laparoscopic surgery, a clear and high-quality visual field is critical for surgeons to make accurate intraoperative decisions. However, persistent visual degradation, including smoke generated by energy devices, lens fogging from thermal gradients, and lens contamination due to blood or tissue fluid splashes during surgical procedures, severely impair visual clarity. These degenerations can seriously hinder surgical workflow and pose risks to patient safety. To systematically investigate and address various forms of surgical scene degradation, we introduce a real-world open-source surgical image restoration dataset covering laparoscopic environments, called SurgClean, which involves multi-type image restoration tasks, e.g., desmoking, defogging, and desplashing. SurgClean comprises 1,020 images with diverse degradation types and corresponding paired reference labels. Based on SurgClean, we establish a standardized evaluation benchmark and provide performance for 22 representative generic task-specific image restoration approaches, including 12 generic and 10 task-specific image restoration approaches. Experimental results reveal substantial performance gaps relative to clinical requirements, highlighting a critical opportunity for algorithm advancements in intelligent surgical restoration. Furthermore, we explore the degradation discrepancies between surgical and natural scenes from structural perception and semantic understanding perspectives, providing fundamental insights for domain-specific image restoration research. Our work aims to empower the capabilities of restoration algorithms to increase surgical environments and improve the efficiency of clinical procedures.</p></details> |  |
| **[Freqformer: Image-Demoiréing Transformer via Efficient Frequency Decomposition](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.19120v1)** | 2025-05-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Image demoir\'eing remains a challenging task due to the complex interplay between texture corruption and color distortions caused by moir\'e patterns. Existing methods, especially those relying on direct image-to-image restoration, often fail to disentangle these intertwined artifacts effectively. While wavelet-based frequency-aware approaches offer a promising direction, their potential remains underexplored. In this paper, we present Freqformer, a Transformer-based framework specifically designed for image demoir\'eing through targeted frequency separation. Our method performs an effective frequency decomposition that explicitly splits moir\'e patterns into high-frequency spatially-localized textures and low-frequency scale-robust color distortions, which are then handled by a dual-branch architecture tailored to their distinct characteristics. We further propose a learnable Frequency Composition Transform (FCT) module to adaptively fuse the frequency-specific outputs, enabling consistent and high-fidelity reconstruction. To better aggregate the spatial dependencies and the inter-channel complementary information, we introduce a Spatial-Aware Channel Attention (SA-CA) module that refines moir\'e-sensitive regions without incurring high computational cost. Extensive experiments on various demoir\'eing benchmarks demonstrate that Freqformer achieves state-of-the-art performance with a compact model size. The code is publicly available at https://github.com/xyLiu339/Freqformer.</p></details> |  |

Despite recent advances, most existing approaches treat IR as a direct mapping problem, relying on shared representations across degradation types without modeling their structural diversity. In this work, we present MIRAGE, a unified and lightweight framework for all in one IR that explicitly decomposes the input feature space into three semantically aligned parallel branches, each processed by a specialized module attention for global context, convolution for local textures, and MLP for channel-wise statistics. This modular decomposition significantly improves generalization and efficiency across diverse degradations. Furthermore, we introduce a cross layer contrastive learning scheme that aligns shallow and latent features to enhance the discriminability of shared representations. To better capture the underlying geometry of feature representations, we perform contrastive learning in a Symmetric Positive Definite (SPD) manifold space rather than the conventional Euclidean space. Extensive experiments show that MIRAGE not only achieves new state of the art performance across a variety of degradation types but also offers a scalable solution for challenging all-in-one IR scenarios.

However, these LDM-based frameworks suffer from slow inference due to their iterative denoising process, rendering them impractical for time-sensitive applications. To address this, we propose RestoreVAR, a novel generative approach for AiOR that significantly outperforms LDM-based models in restoration performance while achieving over $\mathbf{10\times}$ faster inference. RestoreVAR leverages visual autoregressive modeling (VAR), a recently introduced approach which performs scale-space autoregression for image generation. VAR achieves comparable performance to that of state-of-the-art diffusion transformers with drastically reduced computational costs. To optimally exploit these advantages of VAR for AiOR, we propose architectural modifications and improvements, including intricately designed cross-attention mechanisms and a latent-space refinement module, tailored for the AiOR task. Extensive experiments show that RestoreVAR achieves state-of-the-art performance among generative AiOR methods, while also exhibiting strong generalization capabilities.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project page: https://sudraj2002.github.io/restorevarpage/</p></details> |

However, UniDB's reliance on iterative Euler sampling methods results in slow, computationally expensive inference, while existing acceleration techniques for diffusion or diffusion bridge models fail to address its unique challenges: missing terminal mean constraints and SOC-specific penalty coefficients in its SDEs. We present UniDB++, a training-free sampling algorithm that significantly improves upon these limitations. The method's key advancement comes from deriving exact closed-form solutions for UniDB's reverse-time SDEs, effectively reducing the error accumulation inherent in Euler approximations and enabling high-quality generation with up to 20$\times$ fewer sampling steps. This method is further complemented by replacing conventional noise prediction with a more stable data prediction model, along with an SDE-Corrector mechanism that maintains perceptual quality for low-step regimes (5-10 steps). Additionally, we demonstrate that UniDB++ aligns with existing diffusion bridge acceleration methods by evaluating their update rules, and UniDB++ can recover DBIMs as special cases under some theoretical conditions. Experiments demonstrate UniDB++'s state-of-the-art performance in image restoration tasks, outperforming Euler-based methods in fidelity and speed while reducing inference time significantly. This work bridges the gap between theoretical generality and practical efficiency in SOC-driven diffusion bridge models.

Accurately estimating the underlying degradation can intuitively provide restoration models with more targeted and effective guidance, enabling adaptive processing strategies. To this end, we propose a Morton-Order Degradation Estimation Mechanism (MODEM) for adverse weather image restoration. Central to MODEM is the Morton-Order 2D-Selective-Scan Module (MOS2D), which integrates Morton-coded spatial ordering with selective state-space models to capture long-range dependencies while preserving local structural coherence. Complementing MOS2D, we introduce a Dual Degradation Estimation Module (DDEM) that disentangles and estimates both global and local degradation priors. These priors dynamically condition the MOS2D modules, facilitating adaptive and context-aware restoration. Extensive experiments and ablation studies demonstrate that MODEM achieves state-of-the-art results across multiple benchmarks and weather types, highlighting its effectiveness in modeling complex degradation dynamics. Our code will be released at https://github.com/hainuo-wang/MODEM.git.</p></details> |  |

In contrast to traditional diffusion models that rely on a coupled forward-backward diffusion scheme, FoD directly learns data generation through a single forward diffusion process, yielding a simple yet efficient generative framework. The core of FoD is a state-dependent linear stochastic differential equation that involves a mean-reverting term in both the drift and diffusion functions. This mean-reversion property guarantees the convergence to clean data, naturally simulating a stochastic interpolation between source and target distributions. More importantly, FoD is analytically tractable and is trained using a simple stochastic flow matching objective, enabling a few-step non-Markov chain sampling during inference. The proposed FoD model, despite its simplicity, achieves competitive performance on various image-conditioned (e.g., image restoration) and unconditional generation tasks, demonstrating its effectiveness in generative modelling.

Generally, existing methods can be degradation-agnostic or degradation-aware. However, the former are limited in leveraging degradation-specific restoration, and the latter suffer from the inevitable error in degradation estimation. Consequently, the performance of existing methods has a large gap compared to specific single-task models. In this work, we make a step forward in this topic, and present our UniRestorer with improved restoration performance. Specifically, we perform hierarchical clustering on degradation space, and train a multi-granularity mixture-of-experts (MoE) restoration model. Then, UniRestorer adopts both degradation and granularity estimation to adaptively select an appropriate expert for image restoration. In contrast to existing degradation-agnostic and -aware methods, UniRestorer can leverage degradation estimation to benefit degradation specific restoration, and use granularity estimation to make the model robust to degradation estimation error. Experimental results show that our UniRestorer outperforms state-of-the-art all-in-one methods by a large margin, and is promising in closing the performance gap to specific single task models.</p></details> |  |

This paper first explores the challenging multi-weather nighttime image restoration task, where various types of weather degradations are intertwined with flare effects. To support the research, we contribute the AllWeatherNight dataset, featuring large-scale high-quality nighttime images with diverse compositional degradations, synthesized using our introduced illumination-aware degradation generation. Moreover, we present ClearNight, a unified nighttime image restoration framework, which effectively removes complex degradations in one go. Specifically, ClearNight extracts Retinex-based dual priors and explicitly guides the network to focus on uneven illumination regions and intrinsic texture contents respectively, thereby enhancing restoration effectiveness in nighttime scenarios. In order to better represent the common and unique characters of multiple weather degradations, we introduce a weather-aware dynamic specific-commonality collaboration method, which identifies weather degradations and adaptively selects optimal candidate units associated with specific weather types. Our ClearNight achieves state-of-the-art performance on both synthetic and real-world images. Comprehensive ablation experiments validate the necessity of AllWeatherNight dataset as well as the effectiveness of ClearNight.

As compared with the traditional discrete framework, the continuous framework demonstrates inherent superiority for data representation and reconstruction (e.g., image restoration, novel view synthesis, and waveform inversion) by offering inherent advantages including resolution flexibility, cross-modal adaptability, inherent smoothness, and parameter efficiency. In this review, we systematically examine recent advancements in continuous representation frameworks, focusing on three aspects: (i) Continuous representation method designs such as basis function representation, statistical modeling, tensor function decomposition, and implicit neural representation; (ii) Theoretical foundations of continuous representations such as approximation error analysis, convergence property, and implicit regularization; (iii) Real-world applications of continuous representations derived from computer vision, graphics, bioinformatics, and remote sensing.

However, the quadratic complexity of self-attention in Transformer hinders its applicability to high-resolution images. Existing methods mitigate this issue with sparse or window-based attention, yet inherently limit global context modeling. Linear attention, a variant of softmax attention, demonstrates promise in global context modeling while maintaining linear complexity, offering a potential solution to the above challenge. Despite its efficiency benefits, vanilla linear attention suffers from a significant performance drop in IR, largely due to the low-rank nature of its attention map. To counter this, we propose Rank Enhanced Linear Attention (RELA), a simple yet effective method that enriches feature representations by integrating a lightweight depthwise convolution. Building upon RELA, we propose an efficient and effective image restoration Transformer, named LAformer. LAformer achieves effective global perception by integrating linear attention and channel attention, while also enhancing local fitting capabilities through a convolutional gated feed-forward network. Notably, LAformer eliminates hardware-inefficient operations such as softmax and window shifting, enabling efficient processing of high-resolution images. Extensive experiments across 7 IR tasks and 21 benchmarks demonstrate that LAformer outperforms SOTA methods and offers significant computational advantages.</p></details> | <details><summary>13 pa...</summary><p>13 pages, 7 figures, 12 tables</p></details> |
| **[UHD Image Dehazing via anDehazeFormer with Atmospheric-aware KV Cache](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.14010v1)** | 2025-05-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In this paper, we propose an efficient visual transformer framework for ultra-high-definition (UHD) image dehazing that addresses the key challenges of slow training speed and high memory consumption for existing methods. Our approach introduces two key innovations: 1) an \textbf{a}daptive \textbf{n}ormalization mechanism inspired by the nGPT architecture that enables ultra-fast and stable training with a network with a restricted range of parameter expressions; and 2) we devise an atmospheric scattering-aware KV caching mechanism that dynamically optimizes feature preservation based on the physical haze formation model. The proposed architecture improves the training convergence speed by \textbf{5 $\times$} while reducing memory overhead, enabling real-time processing of 50 high-resolution images per second on an RTX4090 GPU. Experimental results show that our approach maintains state-of-the-art dehazing quality while significantly improving computational efficiency for 4K/8K image restoration tasks. Furthermore, we provide a new dehazing image interpretable method with the help of an integrated gradient attribution map. Our code can be found here: https://anonymous.4open.science/r/anDehazeFormer-632E/README.md.</p></details> | Under review |
| **[Adaptive Image Restoration for Video Surveillance: A Real-Time Approach](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.13130v1)** | 2025-05-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>One of the major challenges in the field of computer vision especially for detection, segmentation, recognition, monitoring, and automated solutions, is the quality of images. Image degradation, often caused by factors such as rain, fog, lighting, etc., has a negative impact on automated decision-making.Furthermore, several image restoration solutions exist, including restoration models for single degradation and restoration models for multiple degradations. However, these solutions are not suitable for real-time processing. In this study, the aim was to develop a real-time image restoration solution for video surveillance. To achieve this, using transfer learning with ResNet_50, we developed a model for automatically identifying the types of degradation present in an image to reference the necessary treatment(s) for image restoration. Our solution has the advantage of being flexible and scalable.</p></details> |  |
| **[LatentINDIGO: An INN-Guided Latent Diffusion Algorithm for Image Restoration](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.12935v1)** | 2025-05-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>There is a growing interest in the use of latent diffusion models (LDMs) for image restoration (IR) tasks due to their ability to model effectively the distribution of natural images. While significant progress has been made, there are still key challenges that need to be addressed. First, many approaches depend on a predefined degradation operator, making them ill-suited for complex or unknown degradations that deviate from standard analytical models. Second, many methods struggle to provide a stable guidance in the latent space and finally most methods convert latent representations back to the pixel domain for guidance at every sampling iteration, which significantly increases computational and memory overhead. To overcome these limitations, we introduce a wavelet-inspired invertible neural network (INN) that simulates degradations through a forward transform and reconstructs lost details via the inverse transform. We further integrate this design into a latent diffusion pipeline through two proposed approaches: LatentINDIGO-PixelINN, which operates in the pixel domain, and LatentINDIGO-LatentINN, which stays fully in the latent space to reduce complexity. Both approaches alternate between updating intermediate latent variables under the guidance of our INN and refining the INN forward model to handle unknown degradations. In addition, a regularization step preserves the proximity of latent variables to the natural image manifold. Experiments demonstrate that our algorithm achieves state-of-the-art performance on synthetic and real-world low-quality images, and can be readily adapted to arbitrary output sizes.</p></details> | <details><summary>Submi...</summary><p>Submitted to IEEE Transactions on Image Processing (TIP)</p></details> |
| **[Towards a Universal Image Degradation Model via Content-Degradation Disentanglement](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.12860v1)** | 2025-05-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Image degradation synthesis is highly desirable in a wide variety of applications ranging from image restoration to simulating artistic effects. Existing models are designed to generate one specific or a narrow set of degradations, which often require user-provided degradation parameters. As a result, they lack the generalizability to synthesize degradations beyond their initial design or adapt to other applications. Here we propose the first universal degradation model that can synthesize a broad spectrum of complex and realistic degradations containing both homogeneous (global) and inhomogeneous (spatially varying) components. Our model automatically extracts and disentangles homogeneous and inhomogeneous degradation features, which are later used for degradation synthesis without user intervention. A disentangle-by-compression method is proposed to separate degradation information from images. Two novel modules for extracting and incorporating inhomogeneous degradations are created to model inhomogeneous components in complex degradations. We demonstrate the model's accuracy and adaptability in film-grain simulation and blind image restoration tasks. The demo video, code, and dataset of this project will be released upon publication at github.com/yangwenbo99/content-degradation-disentanglement.</p></details> |  |
| **[Degradation-Aware Feature Perturbation for All-in-One Image Restoration](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.12630v1)** | 2025-05-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>All-in-one image restoration aims to recover clear images from various degradation types and levels with a unified model. Nonetheless, the significant variations among degradation types present challenges for training a universal model, often resulting in task interference, where the gradient update directions of different tasks may diverge due to shared parameters. To address this issue, motivated by the routing strategy, we propose DFPIR, a novel all-in-one image restorer that introduces Degradation-aware Feature Perturbations(DFP) to adjust the feature space to align with the unified parameter space. In this paper, the feature perturbations primarily include channel-wise perturbations and attention-wise perturbations. Specifically, channel-wise perturbations are implemented by shuffling the channels in high-dimensional space guided by degradation types, while attention-wise perturbations are achieved through selective masking in the attention space. To achieve these goals, we propose a Degradation-Guided Perturbation Block (DGPB) to implement these two functions, positioned between the encoding and decoding stages of the encoder-decoder architecture. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that DFPIR achieves state-of-the-art performance on several all-in-one image restoration tasks including image denoising, image dehazing, image deraining, motion deblurring, and low-light image enhancement.

| **[A Preliminary Study for GPT-4o on Image Restoration](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.05621v2)** | 2025-05-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>OpenAI's GPT-4o model, integrating multi-modal inputs and outputs within an autoregressive architecture, has demonstrated unprecedented performance in image generation. In this work, we investigate its potential impact on the image restoration community. We present the first systematic evaluation of GPT-4o across diverse restoration tasks. Our experiments reveal that, although restoration outputs from GPT-4o are visually appealing, they often suffer from pixel-level structural fidelity when compared to ground-truth images. Common issues are variations in image proportions, shifts in object positions and quantities, and changes in viewpoint. To address it, taking image dehazing, derainning, and low-light enhancement as representative case studies, we show that GPT-4o's outputs can serve as powerful visual priors, substantially enhancing the performance of existing dehazing networks. It offers practical guidelines and a baseline framework to facilitate the integration of GPT-4o into future image restoration pipelines. We hope the study on GPT-4o image restoration will accelerate innovation in the broader field of image generation areas. To support further research, we will release GPT-4o-restored images.</p></details> |  |
| **[Behind the Noise: Conformal Quantile Regression Reveals Emergent Representations](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.08176v1)** | 2025-05-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Scientific imaging often involves long acquisition times to obtain high-quality data, especially when probing complex, heterogeneous systems. However, reducing acquisition time to increase throughput inevitably introduces significant noise into the measurements. We present a machine learning approach that not only denoises low-quality measurements with calibrated uncertainty bounds, but also reveals emergent structure in the latent space. By using ensembles of lightweight, randomly structured neural networks trained via conformal quantile regression, our method performs reliable denoising while uncovering interpretable spatial and chemical features -- without requiring labels or segmentation. Unlike conventional approaches focused solely on image restoration, our framework leverages the denoising process itself to drive the emergence of meaningful representations. We validate the approach on real-world geobiochemical imaging data, showing how it supports confident interpretation and guides experimental design under resource constraints.</p></details> |  |
| **[Generalizable Pancreas Segmentation via a Dual Self-Supervised Learning Framework](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.07165v1)** | 2025-05-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recently, numerous pancreas segmentation methods have achieved promising performance on local single-source datasets. However, these methods don't adequately account for generalizability issues, and hence typically show limited performance and low stability on test data from other sources. Considering the limited availability of distinct data sources, we seek to improve the generalization performance of a pancreas segmentation model trained with a single-source dataset, i.e., the single source generalization task. In particular, we propose a dual self-supervised learning model that incorporates both global and local anatomical contexts. Our model aims to fully exploit the anatomical features of the intra-pancreatic and extra-pancreatic regions, and hence enhance the characterization of the high-uncertainty regions for more robust generalization. Specifically, we first construct a global-feature contrastive self-supervised learning module that is guided by the pancreatic spatial structure. This module obtains complete and consistent pancreatic features through promoting intra-class cohesion, and also extracts more discriminative features for differentiating between pancreatic and non-pancreatic tissues through maximizing inter-class separation. It mitigates the influence of surrounding tissue on the segmentation outcomes in high-uncertainty regions. Subsequently, a local-image restoration self-supervised learning module is introduced to further enhance the characterization of the high uncertainty regions. In this module, informative anatomical contexts are actually learned to recover randomly corrupted appearance patterns in those regions.</p></details> | <details><summary>accep...</summary><p>accept by IEEE JBHI.

| **[UnfoldIR: Rethinking Deep Unfolding Network in Illumination Degradation Image Restoration](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.06683v1)** | 2025-05-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Deep unfolding networks (DUNs) are widely employed in illumination degradation image restoration (IDIR) to merge the interpretability of model-based approaches with the generalization of learning-based methods. However, the performance of DUN-based methods remains considerably inferior to that of state-of-the-art IDIR solvers. Our investigation indicates that this limitation does not stem from structural shortcomings of DUNs but rather from the limited exploration of the unfolding structure, particularly for (1) constructing task-specific restoration models, (2) integrating advanced network architectures, and (3) designing DUN-specific loss functions. To address these issues, we propose a novel DUN-based method, UnfoldIR, for IDIR tasks. UnfoldIR first introduces a new IDIR model with dedicated regularization terms for smoothing illumination and enhancing texture. We unfold the iterative optimized solution of this model into a multistage network, with each stage comprising a reflectance-assisted illumination correction (RAIC) module and an illumination-guided reflectance enhancement (IGRE) module. RAIC employs a visual state space (VSS) to extract non-local features, enforcing illumination smoothness, while IGRE introduces a frequency-aware VSS to globally align similar textures, enabling mildly degraded regions to guide the enhancement of details in more severely degraded areas. This suppresses noise while enhancing details. Furthermore, given the multistage structure, we propose an inter-stage information consistent loss to maintain network stability in the final stages. This loss contributes to structural preservation and sustains the model's performance even in unsupervised settings. Experiments verify our effectiveness across 5 IDIR tasks and 3 downstream problems.</p></details> | <details><summary>16 pa...</summary><p>16 pages, 14 tables, 11 figures</p></details> |

Current approaches face a clear limitation: 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) methods produce high-quality results but require multiple views or video sequences, while video diffusion models can generate animations from single images but struggle with consistency and identity preservation. We present SVAD, a novel approach that addresses these limitations by leveraging complementary strengths of existing techniques. Our method generates synthetic training data through video diffusion, enhances it with identity preservation and image restoration modules, and utilizes this refined data to train 3DGS avatars. Comprehensive evaluations demonstrate that SVAD outperforms state-of-the-art (SOTA) single-image methods in maintaining identity consistency and fine details across novel poses and viewpoints, while enabling real-time rendering capabilities. Through our data augmentation pipeline, we overcome the dependency on dense monocular or multi-view training data typically required by traditional 3DGS approaches. Extensive quantitative, qualitative comparisons show our method achieves superior performance across multiple metrics against baseline models. By effectively combining the generative power of diffusion models with both the high-quality results and rendering efficiency of 3DGS, our work establishes a new approach for high-fidelity avatar generation from a single image input.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by CVPR 2025 SyntaGen Workshop, Project Page: https://yc4ny.github.io/SVAD/</p></details> |
| **[DGSolver: Diffusion Generalist Solver with Universal Posterior Sampling for Image Restoration](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.21487v2)** | 2025-05-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Diffusion models have achieved remarkable progress in universal image restoration. While existing methods speed up inference by reducing sampling steps, substantial step intervals often introduce cumulative errors. Moreover, they struggle to balance the commonality of degradation representations and restoration quality. To address these challenges, we introduce \textbf{DGSolver}, a diffusion generalist solver with universal posterior sampling. We first derive the exact ordinary differential equations for generalist diffusion models and tailor high-order solvers with a queue-based accelerated sampling strategy to improve both accuracy and efficiency. We then integrate universal posterior sampling to better approximate manifold-constrained gradients, yielding a more accurate noise estimation and correcting errors in inverse inference. Extensive experiments show that DGSolver outperforms state-of-the-art methods in restoration accuracy, stability, and scalability, both qualitatively and quantitatively.

Moreover, these methods often utilize highly customized backbones, which hinder their adaptability and integration into more advanced restoration networks. To address these limitations, we propose Perceive-IR, a novel backbone-agnostic All-in-One image restoration framework designed for fine-grained quality control across various degradation types and severity levels. Its modular structure allows core components to function independently of specific backbones, enabling seamless integration into advanced restoration models without significant modifications. Specifically, Perceive-IR operates in two key stages: 1) multi-level quality-driven prompt learning stage, where a fine-grained quality perceiver is meticulously trained to discern three tier quality levels by optimizing the alignment between prompts and images within the CLIP perception space. This stage ensures a nuanced understanding of image quality, laying the groundwork for subsequent restoration; 2) restoration stage, where the quality perceiver is seamlessly integrated with a difficulty-adaptive perceptual loss, forming a quality-aware learning strategy. This strategy not only dynamically differentiates sample learning difficulty but also achieves fine-grained quality control by driving the restored image toward the ground truth while pulling it away from both low- and medium-quality samples.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by IEEE Transactions on Image Processing.

| **[Image Restoration via Multi-domain Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.05504v1)** | 2025-05-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Due to adverse atmospheric and imaging conditions, natural images suffer from various degradation phenomena. Consequently, image restoration has emerged as a key solution and garnered substantial attention. Although recent Transformer architectures have demonstrated impressive success across various restoration tasks, their considerable model complexity poses significant challenges for both training and real-time deployment. Furthermore, instead of investigating the commonalities among different degradations, most existing restoration methods focus on modifying Transformer under limited restoration priors. In this work, we first review various degradation phenomena under multi-domain perspective, identifying common priors. Then, we introduce a novel restoration framework, which integrates multi-domain learning into Transformer. Specifically, in Token Mixer, we propose a Spatial-Wavelet-Fourier multi-domain structure that facilitates local-region-global multi-receptive field modeling to replace vanilla self-attention. Additionally, in Feed-Forward Network, we incorporate multi-scale learning to fuse multi-domain features at different resolutions. Comprehensive experimental results across ten restoration tasks, such as dehazing, desnowing, motion deblurring, defocus deblurring, rain streak/raindrop removal, cloud removal, shadow removal, underwater enhancement and low-light enhancement, demonstrate that our proposed model outperforms state-of-the-art methods and achieves a favorable trade-off among restoration performance, parameter size, computational cost and inference latency.

| **[Infrared Image Deturbulence Restoration Using Degradation Parameter-Assisted Wide & Deep Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2305.18708v2)** | 2025-05-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Infrared images captured under turbulent conditions are degraded by complex geometric distortions and blur. We address infrared deturbulence as an image restoration task, proposing DparNet, a parameter-assisted multi-frame network with a wide & deep architecture. DparNet learns a degradation prior (key parameter matrix) directly from degraded images without external knowledge. Its wide & deep architecture uses these learned parameters to directly modulate restoration, achieving spatially and intensity adaptive results. Evaluated on dedicated infrared deturbulence (49,744 images) and visible image denoising (109,536 images) datasets, DparNet significantly outperforms State-of-the-Art (SOTA) methods in restoration performance and efficiency. Notably, leveraging these parameters improves PSNR by 0.6-1.1 dB with less than 2% increase in model parameters and computational complexity. Our work demonstrates that degraded images hide key degradation information that can be learned and utilized to boost adaptive image restoration.</p></details> |  |
| **[Multi-Scale Target-Aware Representation Learning for Fundus Image Enhancement](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.01831v1)** | 2025-05-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>High-quality fundus images provide essential anatomical information for clinical screening and ophthalmic disease diagnosis. Yet, due to hardware limitations, operational variability, and patient compliance, fundus images often suffer from low resolution and signal-to-noise ratio. Recent years have witnessed promising progress in fundus image enhancement. However, existing works usually focus on restoring structural details or global characteristics of fundus images, lacking a unified image enhancement framework to recover comprehensive multi-scale information. Moreover, few methods pinpoint the target of image enhancement, e.g., lesions, which is crucial for medical image-based diagnosis. To address these challenges, we propose a multi-scale target-aware representation learning framework (MTRL-FIE) for efficient fundus image enhancement. Specifically, we propose a multi-scale feature encoder (MFE) that employs wavelet decomposition to embed both low-frequency structural information and high-frequency details. Next, we design a structure-preserving hierarchical decoder (SHD) to fuse multi-scale feature embeddings for real fundus image restoration. SHD integrates hierarchical fusion and group attention mechanisms to achieve adaptive feature fusion while retaining local structural smoothness. Meanwhile, a target-aware feature aggregation (TFA) module is used to enhance pathological regions and reduce artifacts. Experimental results on multiple fundus image datasets demonstrate the effectiveness and generalizability of MTRL-FIE for fundus image enhancement. Compared to state-of-the-art methods, MTRL-FIE achieves superior enhancement performance with a more lightweight architecture. Furthermore, our approach generalizes to other ophthalmic image processing tasks without supervised fine-tuning, highlighting its potential for clinical applications.</p></details> | <details><summary>Under...</summary><p>Under review at Neural Networks</p></details> |

Existing diffusion-based SR approaches typically adapt pre-trained generative models to image restoration tasks by adding extra conditioning on a VAE-downsampled representation of the degraded input, which often compromises structural fidelity. GuideSR addresses this limitation by introducing a dual-branch architecture comprising: (1) a Guidance Branch that preserves high-fidelity structures from the original-resolution degraded input, and (2) a Diffusion Branch, which a pre-trained latent diffusion model to enhance perceptual quality. Unlike conventional conditioning mechanisms, our Guidance Branch features a tailored structure for image restoration tasks, combining Full Resolution Blocks (FRBs) with channel attention and an Image Guidance Network (IGN) with guided attention. By embedding detailed structural information directly into the restoration pipeline, GuideSR produces sharper and more visually consistent results. Extensive experiments on benchmark datasets demonstrate that GuideSR achieves state-of-the-art performance while maintaining the low computational cost of single-step approaches, with up to 1.39dB PSNR gain on challenging real-world datasets. Our approach consistently outperforms existing methods across various reference-based metrics including PSNR, SSIM, LPIPS, DISTS and FID, further representing a practical advancement for real-world image restoration.</p></details> |  |

Among these, marine snow, which is suspended organic particles appearing as bright spots or noise, significantly impacts machine vision tasks, particularly those involving feature matching. Existing methods for removing marine snow are ineffective due to the lack of paired training data. To address this challenge, this paper proposes a novel enhancement framework that introduces a new approach for generating paired datasets from raw underwater videos. The resulting dataset consists of paired images of generated snowy and snow, free underwater videos, enabling supervised training for video enhancement. We describe the dataset creation process, highlight its key characteristics, and demonstrate its effectiveness in enhancing underwater image restoration in the absence of ground truth.</p></details> |  |

Unlike object-based tasks, such as generating 360{\deg} views of a car, scene view synthesis handles entire environments where non-uniform observations pose unique challenges for stable rendering quality. To address this issue, we propose a novel approach: renderability field-guided gaussian splatting (RF-GS). This method quantifies input inhomogeneity through a renderability field, guiding pseudo-view sampling to enhanced visual consistency. To ensure the quality of wide-baseline pseudo-views, we train an image restoration model to map point projections to visible-light styles. Additionally, our validated hybrid data optimization strategy effectively fuses information of pseudo-view angles and source view textures. Comparative experiments on simulated and real-world data show that our method outperforms existing approaches in rendering stability.</p></details> | 8 pages,8 figures |

Approach:We propose a novel diffusion-based SR framework called Res-SRDiff, which integrates residual error shifting into the forward diffusion process. This enables efficient HR image reconstruction by aligning the degraded HR and LR distributions.We evaluated Res-SRDiff on ultra-high-field brain T1 MP2RAGE maps and T2-weighted prostate images, comparing it with Bicubic, Pix2pix, CycleGAN, and a conventional denoising diffusion probabilistic model with vision transformer backbone (TM-DDPM), using quantitative metrics such as peak signal-to-noise ratio (PSNR), structural similarity index (SSIM), gradient magnitude similarity deviation (GMSD), and learned perceptual image patch similarity (LPIPS). Main results: Res-SRDiff significantly outperformed all comparative methods in terms of PSNR, SSIM, and GMSD across both datasets, with statistically significant improvements (p-values<<0.05). The model achieved high-fidelity image restoration with only four sampling steps, drastically reducing computational time to under one second per slice, which is substantially faster than conventional TM-DDPM with around 20 seconds per slice. Qualitative analyses further demonstrated that Res-SRDiff effectively preserved fine anatomical details and lesion morphology in both brain and pelvic MRI images. Significance: Our findings show that Res-SRDiff is an efficient and accurate MRI SR method, markedly improving computational efficiency and image quality. Integrating residual error shifting into the diffusion process allows for rapid and robust HR image reconstruction, enhancing clinical MRI workflows and advancing medical imaging research.

| **[DPMambaIR:All-in-One Image Restoration via Degradation-Aware Prompt State Space Model](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.17732v1)** | 2025-04-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>All-in-One image restoration aims to address multiple image degradation problems using a single model, significantly reducing training costs and deployment complexity compared to traditional methods that design dedicated models for each degradation type. Existing approaches typically rely on Degradation-specific models or coarse-grained degradation prompts to guide image restoration. However, they lack fine-grained modeling of degradation information and face limitations in balancing multi-task conflicts. To overcome these limitations, we propose DPMambaIR, a novel All-in-One image restoration framework. By integrating a Degradation-Aware Prompt State Space Model (DP-SSM) and a High-Frequency Enhancement Block (HEB), DPMambaIR enables fine-grained modeling of complex degradation information and efficient global integration, while mitigating the loss of high-frequency details caused by task competition. Specifically, the DP-SSM utilizes a pre-trained degradation extractor to capture fine-grained degradation features and dynamically incorporates them into the state space modeling process, enhancing the model's adaptability to diverse degradation types. Concurrently, the HEB supplements high-frequency information, effectively addressing the loss of critical details, such as edges and textures, in multi-task image restoration scenarios. Extensive experiments on a mixed dataset containing seven degradation types show that DPMambaIR achieves the best performance, with 27.69dB and 0.893 in PSNR and SSIM, respectively. These results highlight the potential and superiority of DPMambaIR as a unified solution for All-in-One image restoration.</p></details> |  |
| **[Dual Prompting Image Restoration with Diffusion Transformers](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.17825v1)** | 2025-04-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent state-of-the-art image restoration methods mostly adopt latent diffusion models with U-Net backbones, yet still facing challenges in achieving high-quality restoration due to their limited capabilities. Diffusion transformers (DiTs), like SD3, are emerging as a promising alternative because of their better quality with scalability. In this paper, we introduce DPIR (Dual Prompting Image Restoration), a novel image restoration method that effectivly extracts conditional information of low-quality images from multiple perspectives. Specifically, DPIR consits of two branches: a low-quality image conditioning branch and a dual prompting control branch. The first branch utilizes a lightweight module to incorporate image priors into the DiT with high efficiency. More importantly, we believe that in image restoration, textual description alone cannot fully capture its rich visual characteristics. Therefore, a dual prompting module is designed to provide DiT with additional visual cues, capturing both global context and local appearance. The extracted global-local visual prompts as extra conditional control, alongside textual prompts to form dual prompts, greatly enhance the quality of the restoration. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that DPIR delivers superior image restoration performance.</p></details> | CVPR2025 |
| **[RouteWinFormer: A Route-Window Transformer for Middle-range Attention in Image Restoration](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.16637v1)** | 2025-04-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Transformer models have recently garnered significant attention in image restoration due to their ability to capture long-range pixel dependencies. However, long-range attention often results in computational overhead without practical necessity, as degradation and context are typically localized. Normalized average attention distance across various degradation datasets shows that middle-range attention is enough for image restoration. Building on this insight, we propose RouteWinFormer, a novel window-based Transformer that models middle-range context for image restoration. RouteWinFormer incorporates Route-Windows Attnetion Module, which dynamically selects relevant nearby windows based on regional similarity for attention aggregation, extending the receptive field to a mid-range size efficiently. In addition, we introduce Multi-Scale Structure Regularization during training, enabling the sub-scale of the U-shaped network to focus on structural information, while the original-scale learns degradation patterns based on generalized image structure priors. Extensive experiments demonstrate that RouteWinFormer outperforms state-of-the-art methods across 9 datasets in various image restoration tasks.</p></details> |  |
| **[Cross Paradigm Representation and Alignment Transformer for Image Deraining](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.16455v1)** | 2025-04-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Transformer-based networks have achieved strong performance in low-level vision tasks like image deraining by utilizing spatial or channel-wise self-attention. However, irregular rain patterns and complex geometric overlaps challenge single-paradigm architectures, necessitating a unified framework to integrate complementary global-local and spatial-channel representations. To address this, we propose a novel Cross Paradigm Representation and Alignment Transformer (CPRAformer). Its core idea is the hierarchical representation and alignment, leveraging the strengths of both paradigms (spatial-channel and global-local) to aid image reconstruction. It bridges the gap within and between paradigms, aligning and coordinating them to enable deep interaction and fusion of features. Specifically, we use two types of self-attention in the Transformer blocks: sparse prompt channel self-attention (SPC-SA) and spatial pixel refinement self-attention (SPR-SA). SPC-SA enhances global channel dependencies through dynamic sparsity, while SPR-SA focuses on spatial rain distribution and fine-grained texture recovery. To address the feature misalignment and knowledge differences between them, we introduce the Adaptive Alignment Frequency Module (AAFM), which aligns and interacts with features in a two-stage progressive manner, enabling adaptive guidance and complementarity. This reduces the information gap within and between paradigms. Through this unified cross-paradigm dynamic interaction framework, we achieve the extraction of the most valuable interactive fusion information from the two paradigms. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our model achieves state-of-the-art performance on eight benchmark datasets and further validates CPRAformer's robustness in other image restoration tasks and downstream applications.</p></details> | <details><summary>code:...</summary><p>code: https://github.com/zs1314/CPRAformer</p></details> |

Firstly, we extend the Ambient Diffusion framework to enable training directly from measurements corrupted in the Fourier domain. Subsequently, we train diffusion models for MRI with access only to Fourier subsampled multi-coil measurements at acceleration factors R= 2,4,6,8. Secondly, we propose Ambient Diffusion Posterior Sampling (A-DPS), a reconstruction algorithm that leverages generative models pre-trained on one type of corruption (e.g. image inpainting) to perform posterior sampling on measurements from a different forward process (e.g. image blurring). For MRI reconstruction in high acceleration regimes, we observe that A-DPS models trained on subsampled data are better suited to solving inverse problems than models trained on fully sampled data. We also test the efficacy of A-DPS on natural image datasets (CelebA, FFHQ, and AFHQ) and show that A-DPS can sometimes outperform models trained on clean data for several image restoration tasks in both speed and performance.</p></details> |  |
| **[Acquire and then Adapt: Squeezing out Text-to-Image Model for Image Restoration](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.15159v1)** | 2025-04-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recently, pre-trained text-to-image (T2I) models have been extensively adopted for real-world image restoration because of their powerful generative prior. However, controlling these large models for image restoration usually requires a large number of high-quality images and immense computational resources for training, which is costly and not privacy-friendly. In this paper, we find that the well-trained large T2I model (i.e., Flux) is able to produce a variety of high-quality images aligned with real-world distributions, offering an unlimited supply of training samples to mitigate the above issue. Specifically, we proposed a training data construction pipeline for image restoration, namely FluxGen, which includes unconditional image generation, image selection, and degraded image simulation. A novel light-weighted adapter (FluxIR) with squeeze-and-excitation layers is also carefully designed to control the large Diffusion Transformer (DiT)-based T2I model so that reasonable details can be restored. Experiments demonstrate that our proposed method enables the Flux model to adapt effectively to real-world image restoration tasks, achieving superior scores and visual quality on both synthetic and real-world degradation datasets - at only about 8.5\% of the training cost compared to current approaches.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by CVPR 2025</p></details> |

Leveraging a blend of attribute text prompts, high-quality reference images, and identity information, MGFR can mitigate the generation of false facial attributes and identities often associated with generative face restoration methods. By incorporating a dual-control adapter and a two-stage training strategy, our method effectively utilizes multi-modal prior information for targeted restoration tasks. We also present the Reface-HQ dataset, comprising over 21,000 high-resolution facial images across 4800 identities, to address the need for reference face training images. Our approach achieves superior visual quality in restoring facial details under severe degradation and allows for controlled restoration processes, enhancing the accuracy of identity preservation and attribute correction. Including negative quality samples and attribute prompts in the training further refines the model's ability to generate detailed and perceptually accurate images.</p></details> | <details><summary>23 Pa...</summary><p>23 Pages, 28 Figures, ICLR 2025</p></details> |
| **[Circular Image Deturbulence using Quasi-conformal Geometry](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.13432v2)** | 2025-04-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The presence of inhomogeneous media between optical sensors and objects leads to distorted imaging outputs, significantly complicating downstream image-processing tasks. A key challenge in image restoration is the lack of high-quality, paired-label images required for training supervised models. In this paper, we introduce the Circular Quasi-Conformal Deturbulence (CQCD) framework, an unsupervised approach for removing image distortions through a circular architecture. This design ensures that the restored image remains both geometrically accurate and visually faithful while preventing the accumulation of incorrect estimations. The circular restoration process involves both forward and inverse mapping. To ensure the bijectivity of the estimated non-rigid deformations, computational quasi-conformal geometry theories are leveraged to regularize the mapping, enforcing its homeomorphic properties. This guarantees a well-defined transformation that preserves structural integrity and prevents unwanted artifacts. Furthermore, tight-frame blocks are integrated to encode distortion-sensitive features for precise recovery. To validate the performance of our approach, we conduct evaluations on various synthetic and real-world captured images. Experimental results demonstrate that CQCD not only outperforms existing state-of-the-art deturbulence methods in terms of image restoration quality but also provides highly accurate deformation field estimations.</p></details> |  |
| **[Distribution-aware Dataset Distillation for Efficient Image Restoration](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.14826v1)** | 2025-04-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>With the exponential increase in image data, training an image restoration model is laborious. Dataset distillation is a potential solution to this problem, yet current distillation techniques are a blank canvas in the field of image restoration. To fill this gap, we propose the Distribution-aware Dataset Distillation method (TripleD), a new framework that extends the principles of dataset distillation to image restoration. Specifically, TripleD uses a pre-trained vision Transformer to extract features from images for complexity evaluation, and the subset (the number of samples is much smaller than the original training set) is selected based on complexity. The selected subset is then fed through a lightweight CNN that fine-tunes the image distribution to align with the distribution of the original dataset at the feature level. To efficiently condense knowledge, the training is divided into two stages. Early stages focus on simpler, low-complexity samples to build foundational knowledge, while later stages select more complex and uncertain samples as the model matures. Our method achieves promising performance on multiple image restoration tasks, including multi-task image restoration, all-in-one image restoration, and ultra-high-definition image restoration tasks. Note that we can train a state-of-the-art image restoration model on an ultra-high-definition (4K resolution) dataset using only one consumer-grade GPU in less than 8 hours (500 savings in computing resources and immeasurable training time).</p></details> |  |
| **[An Efficient and Mixed Heterogeneous Model for Image Restoration](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.10967v2)** | 2025-04-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Image restoration~(IR), as a fundamental multimedia data processing task, has a significant impact on downstream visual applications. In recent years, researchers have focused on developing general-purpose IR models capable of handling diverse degradation types, thereby reducing the cost and complexity of model development. Current mainstream approaches are based on three architectural paradigms: CNNs, Transformers, and Mambas. CNNs excel in efficient inference, whereas Transformers and Mamba excel at capturing long-range dependencies and modeling global contexts. While each architecture has demonstrated success in specialized, single-task settings, limited efforts have been made to effectively integrate heterogeneous architectures to jointly address diverse IR challenges. To bridge this gap, we propose RestorMixer, an efficient and general-purpose IR model based on mixed-architecture fusion. RestorMixer adopts a three-stage encoder-decoder structure, where each stage is tailored to the resolution and feature characteristics of the input. In the initial high-resolution stage, CNN-based blocks are employed to rapidly extract shallow local features. In the subsequent stages, we integrate a refined multi-directional scanning Mamba module with a multi-scale window-based self-attention mechanism. This hierarchical and adaptive design enables the model to leverage the strengths of CNNs in local feature extraction, Mamba in global context modeling, and attention mechanisms in dynamic feature refinement. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that RestorMixer achieves leading performance across multiple IR tasks while maintaining high inference efficiency.

| **[Training Neural Networks on RAW and HDR Images for Restoration Tasks](http://arxiv.org/abs/2312.03640v3)** | 2025-04-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The vast majority of standard image and video content available online is represented in display-encoded color spaces, in which pixel values are conveniently scaled to a limited range (0-1) and the color distribution is approximately perceptually uniform. In contrast, both camera RAW and high dynamic range (HDR) images are often represented in linear color spaces, in which color values are linearly related to colorimetric quantities of light. While training on commonly available display-encoded images is a well-established practice, there is no consensus on how neural networks should be trained for tasks on RAW and HDR images in linear color spaces. In this work, we test several approaches on three popular image restoration applications: denoising, deblurring, and single-image super-resolution. We examine whether HDR/RAW images need to be display-encoded using popular transfer functions (PQ, PU21, and mu-law), or whether it is better to train in linear color spaces, but use loss functions that correct for perceptual non-uniformity. Our results indicate that neural networks train significantly better on HDR and RAW images represented in display-encoded color spaces, which offer better perceptual uniformity than linear spaces. This small change to the training strategy can bring a very substantial gain in performance, between 2 and 9 dB.</p></details> |  |
| **[Any Image Restoration via Efficient Spatial-Frequency Degradation Adaptation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.14249v1)** | 2025-04-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Restoring any degraded image efficiently via just one model has become increasingly significant and impactful, especially with the proliferation of mobile devices. Traditional solutions typically involve training dedicated models per degradation, resulting in inefficiency and redundancy. More recent approaches either introduce additional modules to learn visual prompts, significantly increasing model size, or incorporate cross-modal transfer from large language models trained on vast datasets, adding complexity to the system architecture. In contrast, our approach, termed AnyIR, takes a unified path that leverages inherent similarity across various degradations to enable both efficient and comprehensive restoration through a joint embedding mechanism, without scaling up the model or relying on large language models.Specifically, we examine the sub-latent space of each input, identifying key components and reweighting them first in a gated manner. To fuse the intrinsic degradation awareness and the contextualized attention, a spatial-frequency parallel fusion strategy is proposed for enhancing spatial-aware local-global interactions and enriching the restoration details from the frequency perspective. Extensive benchmarking in the all-in-one restoration setting confirms AnyIR's SOTA performance, reducing model complexity by around 82\% in parameters and 85\% in FLOPs.

| **[A Survey of Mamba](http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.01129v6)** | 2025-06-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>As one of the most representative DL techniques, Transformer architecture has empowered numerous advanced models, especially the large language models (LLMs) that comprise billions of parameters, becoming a cornerstone in deep learning. Despite the impressive achievements, Transformers still face inherent limitations, particularly the time-consuming inference resulting from the quadratic computation complexity of attention calculation. Recently, a novel architecture named Mamba, drawing inspiration from classical state space models (SSMs), has emerged as a promising alternative for building foundation models, delivering comparable modeling abilities to Transformers while preserving near-linear scalability concerning sequence length. This has sparked an increasing number of studies actively exploring Mamba's potential to achieve impressive performance across diverse domains. Given such rapid evolution, there is a critical need for a systematic review that consolidates existing Mamba-empowered models, offering a comprehensive understanding of this emerging model architecture. In this survey, we therefore conduct an in-depth investigation of recent Mamba-associated studies, covering three main aspects: the advancements of Mamba-based models, the techniques of adapting Mamba to diverse data, and the applications where Mamba can excel. Specifically, we first review the foundational knowledge of various representative deep learning models and the details of Mamba-1&2 as preliminaries. Then, to showcase the significance of Mamba for AI, we comprehensively review the related studies focusing on Mamba models' architecture design, data adaptability, and applications. Finally, we present a discussion of current limitations and explore various promising research directions to provide deeper insights for future investigations.</p></details> |  |
| **[HyMamba: Mamba with Hybrid Geometry-Feature Coupling for Efficient Point Cloud Classification](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.11099v2)** | 2025-06-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Point cloud classification is one of the essential technologies for achieving intelligent perception of 3D environments by machines, its core challenge is to efficiently extract local and global features. Mamba leverages state space models (SSMs) for global point cloud modeling. Although prior Mamba-based point cloud processing methods pay attention to the limitation of its flattened sequence modeling mechanism in fusing local and global features, the critical issue of weakened local geometric relevance caused by decoupling geometric structures and features in the input patches remains not fully revealed, and both jointly limit local feature extraction. Therefore, we propose HyMamba, a geometry and feature coupled Mamba framework featuring: (1) Geometry-Feature Coupled Pooling (GFCP), which achieves physically interpretable geometric information coupling by dynamically aggregating adjacent geometric information into local features; (2) Collaborative Feature Enhancer (CoFE), which enhances sparse signal capture through cross-path feature hybridization while effectively integrating global and local contexts. We conducted extensive experiments on ModelNet40 and ScanObjectNN datasets. The results demonstrate that the proposed model achieves superior classification performance, particularly on the ModelNet40, where it elevates accuracy to 95.99% with merely 0.03M additional parameters. Furthermore, it attains 98.9% accuracy on the ModelNetFewShot dataset, validating its robust generalization capabilities under sparse samples. Our code and weights are available at https://github.com/L1277471578/HyMamba</p></details> |  |
| **[Scaling Algorithm Distillation for Continuous Control with Mamba](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.13892v1)** | 2025-06-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Algorithm Distillation (AD) was recently proposed as a new approach to perform In-Context Reinforcement Learning (ICRL) by modeling across-episodic training histories autoregressively with a causal transformer model. However, due to practical limitations induced by the attention mechanism, experiments were bottlenecked by the transformer's quadratic complexity and limited to simple discrete environments with short time horizons. In this work, we propose leveraging the recently proposed Selective Structured State Space Sequence (S6) models, which achieved state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance on long-range sequence modeling while scaling linearly in sequence length. Through four complex and continuous Meta Reinforcement Learning environments, we demonstrate the overall superiority of Mamba, a model built with S6 layers, over a transformer model for AD. Additionally, we show that scaling AD to very long contexts can improve ICRL performance and make it competitive even with a SOTA online meta RL baseline.</p></details> |  |
| **[MT-PCR: A Hybrid Mamba-Transformer with Spatial Serialization for Hierarchical Point Cloud Registration](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.13183v1)** | 2025-06-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Point cloud registration (PCR) is a fundamental task in 3D computer vision and robotics. Most existing learning-based PCR methods rely on Transformers, which suffer from quadratic computational complexity. This limitation restricts the resolution of point clouds that can be processed, inevitably leading to information loss. In contrast, Mamba-a recently proposed model based on state space models (SSMs)-achieves linear computational complexity while maintaining strong long-range contextual modeling capabilities. However, directly applying Mamba to PCR tasks yields suboptimal performance due to the unordered and irregular nature of point cloud data. To address this challenge, we propose MT-PCR, the first point cloud registration framework that integrates both Mamba and Transformer modules. Specifically, we serialize point cloud features using Z-order space-filling curves to enforce spatial locality, enabling Mamba to better model the geometric structure of the input. Additionally, we remove the order indicator module commonly used in Mamba-based sequence modeling, leads to improved performance in our setting. The serialized features are then processed by an optimized Mamba encoder, followed by a Transformer refinement stage. Extensive experiments on multiple benchmarks demonstrate that MT-PCR outperforms Transformer-based and concurrent state-of-the-art methods in both accuracy and efficiency, significantly reducing while GPU memory usage and FLOPs.</p></details> | 11 Pages |
| **[An Exploration of Mamba for Speech Self-Supervised Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.12606v1)** | 2025-06-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>While Mamba has demonstrated strong performance in language modeling, its potential as a speech self-supervised (SSL) model remains underexplored, with prior studies limited to isolated tasks. To address this, we explore Mamba-based HuBERT models as alternatives to Transformer-based SSL architectures. Leveraging the linear-time Selective State Space, these models enable fine-tuning on long-context ASR with significantly lower compute. Moreover, they show superior performance when fine-tuned for streaming ASR. Beyond fine-tuning, these models show competitive performance on SUPERB probing benchmarks, particularly in causal settings. Our analysis shows that they yield higher-quality quantized representations and capture speaker-related features more distinctly than Transformer-based models. These findings highlight Mamba-based SSL as a promising and complementary direction for long-sequence modeling, real-time speech modeling, and speech unit extraction.</p></details> |  |
| **[Generalizable Trajectory Prediction via Inverse Reinforcement Learning with Mamba-Graph Architecture](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.12474v1)** | 2025-06-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Accurate driving behavior modeling is fundamental to safe and efficient trajectory prediction, yet remains challenging in complex traffic scenarios. This paper presents a novel Inverse Reinforcement Learning (IRL) framework that captures human-like decision-making by inferring diverse reward functions, enabling robust cross-scenario adaptability. The learned reward function is utilized to maximize the likelihood of output by the encoder-decoder architecture that combines Mamba blocks for efficient long-sequence dependency modeling with graph attention networks to encode spatial interactions among traffic agents. Comprehensive evaluations on urban intersections and roundabouts demonstrate that the proposed method not only outperforms various popular approaches in prediction accuracy but also achieves 2 times higher generalization performance to unseen scenarios compared to other IRL-based method.</p></details> |  |
| **[FAMSeg: Fetal Femur and Cranial Ultrasound Segmentation Using Feature-Aware Attention and Mamba Enhancement](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.07431v2)** | 2025-06-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Accurate ultrasound image segmentation is a prerequisite for precise biometrics and accurate assessment. Relying on manual delineation introduces significant errors and is time-consuming. However, existing segmentation models are designed based on objects in natural scenes, making them difficult to adapt to ultrasound objects with high noise and high similarity. This is particularly evident in small object segmentation, where a pronounced jagged effect occurs. Therefore, this paper proposes a fetal femur and cranial ultrasound image segmentation model based on feature perception and Mamba enhancement to address these challenges. Specifically, a longitudinal and transverse independent viewpoint scanning convolution block and a feature perception module were designed to enhance the ability to capture local detail information and improve the fusion of contextual information. Combined with the Mamba-optimized residual structure, this design suppresses the interference of raw noise and enhances local multi-dimensional scanning. The system builds global information and local feature dependencies, and is trained with a combination of different optimizers to achieve the optimal solution. After extensive experimental validation, the FAMSeg network achieved the fastest loss reduction and the best segmentation performance across images of varying sizes and orientations.</p></details> |  |

However, current segmentation methods frequently encounter challenges in fetal ultrasound images, such as enclosed anatomical structures, blurred boundaries, and small anatomical structures. To address the need for balancing local feature extraction and global context modeling, we propose MS-UMamba, a novel hybrid convolutional-mamba model for fetal ultrasound image segmentation. Specifically, we design a visual state space block integrated with a CNN branch (SS-MCAT-SSM), which leverages Mamba's global modeling strengths and convolutional layers' local representation advantages to enhance feature learning. In addition, we also propose an efficient multi-scale feature fusion module that integrates spatial attention mechanisms, which Integrating feature information from different layers enhances the feature representation ability of the model. Finally, we conduct extensive experiments on a non-public dataset, experimental results demonstrate that MS-UMamba model has excellent performance in segmentation performance.</p></details> |  |
| **[Understanding Input Selectivity in Mamba: Impact on Approximation Power, Memorization, and Associative Recall Capacity](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.11891v1)** | 2025-06-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>State-Space Models (SSMs), and particularly Mamba, have recently emerged as a promising alternative to Transformers. Mamba introduces input selectivity to its SSM layer (S6) and incorporates convolution and gating into its block definition. While these modifications do improve Mamba's performance over its SSM predecessors, it remains largely unclear how Mamba leverages the additional functionalities provided by input selectivity, and how these interact with the other operations in the Mamba architecture. In this work, we demystify the role of input selectivity in Mamba, investigating its impact on function approximation power, long-term memorization, and associative recall capabilities. In particular: (i) we prove that the S6 layer of Mamba can represent projections onto Haar wavelets, providing an edge over its Diagonal SSM (S4D) predecessor in approximating discontinuous functions commonly arising in practice; (ii) we show how the S6 layer can dynamically counteract memory decay; (iii) we provide analytical solutions to the MQAR associative recall task using the Mamba architecture with different mixers -- Mamba, Mamba-2, and S4D. We demonstrate the tightness of our theoretical constructions with empirical results on concrete tasks. Our findings offer a mechanistic understanding of Mamba and reveal opportunities for improvement.</p></details> |  |
| **[Spatiotemporal Field Generation Based on Hybrid Mamba-Transformer with Physics-informed Fine-tuning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.11578v4)** | 2025-06-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This research confronts the challenge of substantial physical equation discrepancies encountered in the generation of spatiotemporal physical fields through data-driven trained models. A spatiotemporal physical field generation model, named HMT-PF, is developed based on the hybrid Mamba-Transformer architecture, incorporating unstructured grid information as input. A fine-tuning block, enhanced with physical information, is introduced to effectively reduce the physical equation discrepancies. The physical equation residuals are computed through a point query mechanism for efficient gradient evaluation, then encoded into latent space for refinement. The fine-tuning process employs a self-supervised learning approach to achieve physical consistency while maintaining essential field characteristics. Results show that the hybrid Mamba-Transformer model achieves good performance in generating spatiotemporal fields, while the physics-informed fine-tuning mechanism further reduces significant physical errors effectively. A MSE-R evaluation method is developed to assess the accuracy and realism of physical field generation.</p></details> |  |
| **[M4V: Multi-Modal Mamba for Text-to-Video Generation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10915v1)** | 2025-06-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Text-to-video generation has significantly enriched content creation and holds the potential to evolve into powerful world simulators. However, modeling the vast spatiotemporal space remains computationally demanding, particularly when employing Transformers, which incur quadratic complexity in sequence processing and thus limit practical applications. Recent advancements in linear-time sequence modeling, particularly the Mamba architecture, offer a more efficient alternative. Nevertheless, its plain design limits its direct applicability to multi-modal and spatiotemporal video generation tasks. To address these challenges, we introduce M4V, a Multi-Modal Mamba framework for text-to-video generation. Specifically, we propose a multi-modal diffusion Mamba (MM-DiM) block that enables seamless integration of multi-modal information and spatiotemporal modeling through a multi-modal token re-composition design. As a result, the Mamba blocks in M4V reduce FLOPs by 45% compared to the attention-based alternative when generating videos at 768$\times$1280 resolution. Additionally, to mitigate the visual quality degradation in long-context autoregressive generation processes, we introduce a reward learning strategy that further enhances per-frame visual realism. Extensive experiments on text-to-video benchmarks demonstrate M4V's ability to produce high-quality videos while significantly lowering computational costs. Code and models will be publicly available at https://huangjch526.github.io/M4V_project.</p></details> |  |
| **[InceptionMamba: An Efficient Hybrid Network with Large Band Convolution and Bottleneck Mamba](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.08735v2)** | 2025-06-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Within the family of convolutional neural networks, InceptionNeXt has shown excellent competitiveness in image classification and a number of downstream tasks. Built on parallel one-dimensional strip convolutions, however, it suffers from limited ability of capturing spatial dependencies along different dimensions and fails to fully explore spatial modeling in local neighborhood. Besides, inherent locality constraints of convolution operations are detrimental to effective global context modeling. To overcome these limitations, we propose a novel backbone architecture termed InceptionMamba in this study. More specifically, the traditional one-dimensional strip convolutions are replaced by orthogonal band convolutions in our InceptionMamba to achieve cohesive spatial modeling. Furthermore, global contextual modeling can be achieved via a bottleneck Mamba module, facilitating enhanced cross-channel information fusion and enlarged receptive field. Extensive evaluations on classification and various downstream tasks demonstrate that the proposed InceptionMamba achieves state-of-the-art performance with superior parameter and computational efficiency.

| **[DART: Differentiable Dynamic Adaptive Region Tokenizer for Vision Transformer and Mamba](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10390v1)** | 2025-06-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recently, non-convolutional models such as the Vision Transformer (ViT) and Vision Mamba (Vim) have achieved remarkable performance in computer vision tasks. However, their reliance on fixed-size patches often results in excessive encoding of background regions and omission of critical local details, especially when informative objects are sparsely distributed. To address this, we introduce a fully differentiable Dynamic Adaptive Region Tokenizer (DART), which adaptively partitions images into content-dependent patches of varying sizes. DART combines learnable region scores with piecewise differentiable quantile operations to allocate denser tokens to information-rich areas. Despite introducing only approximately 1 million (1M) additional parameters, DART improves accuracy by 2.1% on DeiT (ImageNet-1K). Unlike methods that uniformly increase token density to capture fine-grained details, DART offers a more efficient alternative, achieving 45% FLOPs reduction with superior performance. Extensive experiments on DeiT, Vim, and VideoMamba confirm that DART consistently enhances accuracy while incurring minimal or even reduced computational overhead.

| **[Mamba time series forecasting with uncertainty quantification](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.10873v2)** | 2025-06-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>State space models, such as Mamba, have recently garnered attention in time series forecasting due to their ability to capture sequence patterns. However, in electricity consumption benchmarks, Mamba forecasts exhibit a mean error of approximately 8\%. Similarly, in traffic occupancy benchmarks, the mean error reaches 18\%. This discrepancy leaves us to wonder whether the prediction is simply inaccurate or falls within error given spread in historical data. To address this limitation, we propose a method to quantify the predictive uncertainty of Mamba forecasts. Here, we propose a dual-network framework based on the Mamba architecture for probabilistic forecasting, where one network generates point forecasts while the other estimates predictive uncertainty by modeling variance. We abbreviate our tool, Mamba with probabilistic time series forecasting, as Mamba-ProbTSF and the code for its implementation is available on GitHub (https://github.com/PessoaP/Mamba-ProbTSF). Evaluating this approach on synthetic and real-world benchmark datasets, we find Kullback-Leibler divergence between the learned distributions and the data--which, in the limit of infinite data, should converge to zero if the model correctly captures the underlying probability distribution--reduced to the order of $10^{-3}$ for synthetic data and $10^{-1}$ for real-world benchmark, demonstrating its effectiveness. We find that in both the electricity consumption and traffic occupancy benchmark, the true trajectory stays within the predicted uncertainty interval at the two-sigma level about 95\% of the time. We end with a consideration of potential limitations, adjustments to improve performance, and considerations for applying this framework to processes for purely or largely stochastic dynamics where the stochastic changes accumulate, as observed for example in pure Brownian motion or molecular dynamics trajectories.</p></details> |  |

To address these issues, this paper pro-poses a novel Siamese Motion Mamba Tracker (SMMT), which integrates a bidirectional state-space model and a self-attention mechanism. Specifically, we introduce the Motion Mamba module into the Siamese architecture to ex-tract motion features and recover overlooked edge details using bidirectional modeling and self-attention. We propose a Siamese parameter-sharing strate-gy that allows certain convolutional layers to share weights. This approach reduces computational redundancy while preserving strong feature represen-tation. In addition, we design a motion edge-aware regression loss to improve tracking accuracy, especially for motion-blurred targets. Extensive experi-ments are conducted on four TIR tracking benchmarks, including LSOTB-TIR, PTB-TIR, VOT-TIR2015, and VOT-TIR 2017. The results show that SMMT achieves superior performance in TIR target tracking.</p></details> |  |
| **[SMCD: High Realism Motion Style Transfer via Mamba-based Diffusion](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.02844v2)** | 2025-06-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Motion style transfer is a significant research direction in the field of computer vision, enabling virtual digital humans to rapidly switch between different styles of the same motion, thereby significantly enhancing the richness and realism of movements. It has been widely applied in multimedia scenarios such as films, games, and the metaverse. However, most existing methods adopt a two-stream structure, which tends to overlook the intrinsic relationship between content and style motions, leading to information loss and poor alignment. Moreover, when handling long-range motion sequences, these methods fail to effectively learn temporal dependencies, ultimately resulting in unnatural generated motions. To address these limitations, we propose a Unified Motion Style Diffusion (UMSD) framework, which simultaneously extracts features from both content and style motions and facilitates sufficient information interaction. Additionally, we introduce the Motion Style Mamba (MSM) denoiser, the first approach in the field of motion style transfer to leverage Mamba's powerful sequence modelling capability. Better capturing temporal relationships generates more coherent stylized motion sequences. Third, we design a diffusion-based content consistency loss and a style consistency loss to constrain the framework, ensuring that it inherits the content motion while effectively learning the characteristics of the style motion. Finally, extensive experiments demonstrate that our method outperforms state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods qualitatively and quantitatively, achieving more realistic and coherent motion style transfer.</p></details> |  |
| **[KARMA: A Multilevel Decomposition Hybrid Mamba Framework for Multivariate Long-Term Time Series Forecasting](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.08939v1)** | 2025-06-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multivariate long-term and efficient time series forecasting is a key requirement for a variety of practical applications, and there are complex interleaving time dynamics in time series data that require decomposition modeling. Traditional time series decomposition methods are single and rely on fixed rules, which are insufficient for mining the potential information of the series and adapting to the dynamic characteristics of complex series. On the other hand, the Transformer-based models for time series forecasting struggle to effectively model long sequences and intricate dynamic relationships due to their high computational complexity. To overcome these limitations, we introduce KARMA, with an Adaptive Time Channel Decomposition module (ATCD) to dynamically extract trend and seasonal components. It further integrates a Hybrid Frequency-Time Decomposition module (HFTD) to further decompose Series into frequency-domain and time-domain. These components are coupled with multi-scale Mamba-based KarmaBlock to efficiently process global and local information in a coordinated manner. Experiments on eight real-world datasets from diverse domains well demonstrated that KARMA significantly outperforms mainstream baseline methods in both predictive accuracy and computational efficiency.

Although CNNs with Transformer models greatly improve performance, the global context modeling remains inadequate. Recently, Mamba achieved great potential in vision tasks, showing its advantages in modeling long-range dependency. In this paper, we propose a lightweight Efficient CNN-Mamba Network for semantic segmentation, dubbed as ECMNet. ECMNet combines CNN with Mamba skillfully in a capsule-based framework to address their complementary weaknesses. Specifically, We design a Enhanced Dual-Attention Block (EDAB) for lightweight bottleneck. In order to improve the representations ability of feature, We devise a Multi-Scale Attention Unit (MSAU) to integrate multi-scale feature aggregation, spatial aggregation and channel aggregation. Moreover, a Mamba enhanced Feature Fusion Module (FFM) merges diverse level feature, significantly enhancing segmented accuracy. Extensive experiments on two representative datasets demonstrate that the proposed model excels in accuracy and efficiency balance, achieving 70.6% mIoU on Cityscapes and 73.6% mIoU on CamVid test datasets, with 0.87M parameters and 8.27G FLOPs on a single RTX 3090 GPU platform.</p></details> | <details><summary>16 pa...</summary><p>16 pages, 2 figures, 4 tables</p></details> |

Existing Transformer-based methods often suffer from redundant attention and suboptimal multi-modal alignment. To address these limitations, we propose MLVTG, a novel framework that integrates two key modules: MambaAligner and LLMRefiner. MambaAligner uses stacked Vision Mamba blocks as a backbone instead of Transformers to model temporal dependencies and extract robust video representations for multi-modal alignment. LLMRefiner leverages the specific frozen layer of a pre-trained Large Language Model (LLM) to implicitly transfer semantic priors, enhancing multi-modal alignment without fine-tuning. This dual alignment strategy, temporal modeling via structured state-space dynamics and semantic purification via textual priors, enables more precise localization. Extensive experiments on QVHighlights, Charades-STA, and TVSum demonstrate that MLVTG achieves state-of-the-art performance and significantly outperforms existing baselines.</p></details> |  |
| **[SEMA: a Scalable and Efficient Mamba like Attention via Token Localization and Averaging](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.08297v1)** | 2025-06-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Attention is the critical component of a transformer. Yet the quadratic computational complexity of vanilla full attention in the input size and the inability of its linear attention variant to focus have been challenges for computer vision tasks. We provide a mathematical definition of generalized attention and formulate both vanilla softmax attention and linear attention within the general framework. We prove that generalized attention disperses, that is, as the number of keys tends to infinity, the query assigns equal weights to all keys. Motivated by the dispersion property and recent development of Mamba form of attention, we design Scalable and Efficient Mamba like Attention (SEMA) which utilizes token localization to avoid dispersion and maintain focusing, complemented by theoretically consistent arithmetic averaging to capture global aspect of attention. We support our approach on Imagenet-1k where classification results show that SEMA is a scalable and effective alternative beyond linear attention, outperforming recent vision Mamba models on increasingly larger scales of images at similar model parameter sizes.</p></details> | 15 pages, figures 3 |

While existing image restoration efforts have achieved notable success, they are still hindered by two critical challenges: limited generalization across dynamically varying degradation scenarios and a suboptimal balance between preserving local details and modeling global dependencies. To overcome these challenges, we propose M2Restore, a novel Mixture-of-Experts (MoE)-based Mamba-CNN fusion framework for efficient and robust all-in-one image restoration. M2Restore introduces three key contributions: First, to boost the model's generalization across diverse degradation conditions, we exploit a CLIP-guided MoE gating mechanism that fuses task-conditioned prompts with CLIP-derived semantic priors. This mechanism is further refined via cross-modal feature calibration, which enables precise expert selection for various degradation types. Second, to jointly capture global contextual dependencies and fine-grained local details, we design a dual-stream architecture that integrates the localized representational strength of CNNs with the long-range modeling efficiency of Mamba. This integration enables collaborative optimization of global semantic relationships and local structural fidelity, preserving global coherence while enhancing detail restoration. Third, we introduce an edge-aware dynamic gating mechanism that adaptively balances global modeling and local enhancement by reallocating computational attention to degradation-sensitive regions. This targeted focus leads to more efficient and precise restoration. Extensive experiments across multiple image restoration benchmarks validate the superiority of M2Restore in both visual quality and quantitative performance.</p></details> | <details><summary>13 pa...</summary><p>13 pages, 8 figures, 3 tables</p></details> |

To address this, we propose FMaMIL, a novel two-stage framework for weakly supervised lesion segmentation based solely on image-level labels. In the first stage, a lightweight Mamba-based encoder is introduced to capture long-range dependencies across image patches under the MIL paradigm. To enhance spatial sensitivity and structural awareness, we design a learnable frequency-domain encoding module that supplements spatial-domain features with spectrum-based information. CAMs generated in this stage are used to guide segmentation training. In the second stage, we refine the initial pseudo labels via a CAM-guided soft-label supervision and a self-correction mechanism, enabling robust training even under label noise. Extensive experiments on both public and private histopathology datasets demonstrate that FMaMIL outperforms state-of-the-art weakly supervised methods without relying on pixel-level annotations, validating its effectiveness and potential for digital pathology applications.</p></details> |  |
| **[Polar Hierarchical Mamba: Towards Streaming LiDAR Object Detection with Point Clouds as Egocentric Sequences](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.06944v1)** | 2025-06-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Accurate and efficient object detection is essential for autonomous vehicles, where real-time perception requires low latency and high throughput. LiDAR sensors provide robust depth information, but conventional methods process full 360{\deg} scans in a single pass, introducing significant delay. Streaming approaches address this by sequentially processing partial scans in the native polar coordinate system, yet they rely on translation-invariant convolutions that are misaligned with polar geometry -- resulting in degraded performance or requiring complex distortion mitigation. Recent Mamba-based state space models (SSMs) have shown promise for LiDAR perception, but only in the full-scan setting, relying on geometric serialization and positional embeddings that are memory-intensive and ill-suited to streaming. We propose Polar Hierarchical Mamba (PHiM), a novel SSM architecture designed for polar-coordinate streaming LiDAR. PHiM uses local bidirectional Mamba blocks for intra-sector spatial encoding and a global forward Mamba for inter-sector temporal modeling, replacing convolutions and positional encodings with distortion-aware, dimensionally-decomposed operations. PHiM sets a new state-of-the-art among streaming detectors on the Waymo Open Dataset, outperforming the previous best by 10\% and matching full-scan baselines at twice the throughput.

Consequently, existing models perform poorly at identifying flood-related building damages. The model presented in this study, Flood-DamageSense, addresses this gap as the first deep-learning framework purpose-built for building-level flood-damage assessment. The architecture fuses pre- and post-event SAR/InSAR scenes with very-high-resolution optical basemaps and an inherent flood-risk layer that encodes long-term exposure probabilities, guiding the network toward plausibly affected structures even when compositional change is minimal. A multimodal Mamba backbone with a semi-Siamese encoder and task-specific decoders jointly predicts (1) graded building-damage states, (2) floodwater extent, and (3) building footprints. Training and evaluation on Hurricane Harvey (2017) imagery from Harris County, Texas -- supported by insurance-derived property-damage extents -- show a mean F1 improvement of up to 19 percentage points over state-of-the-art baselines, with the largest gains in the frequently misclassified "minor" and "moderate" damage categories. Ablation studies identify the inherent-risk feature as the single most significant contributor to this performance boost. An end-to-end post-processing pipeline converts pixel-level outputs to actionable, building-scale damage maps within minutes of image acquisition. By combining risk-aware modeling with SAR's all-weather capability, Flood-DamageSense delivers faster, finer-grained, and more reliable flood-damage intelligence to support post-disaster decision-making and resource allocation.</p></details> |  |

While State Space Models (SSMs) like Mamba show potential for sequence modeling, existing medical SSMs suffer from encoder-decoder incompatibility: the encoder's 1D sequence flattening compromises spatial structures, while conventional decoders fail to leverage Mamba's state propagation. We present DM-SegNet, a Dual-Mamba architecture integrating directional state transitions with anatomy-aware hierarchical decoding. The core innovations include a quadri-directional spatial Mamba module employing four-directional 3D scanning to maintain anatomical spatial coherence, a gated spatial convolution layer that enhances spatially sensitive feature representation prior to state modeling, and a Mamba-driven decoding framework enabling bidirectional state synchronization across scales. Extensive evaluation on two clinically significant benchmarks demonstrates the efficacy of DM-SegNet: achieving state-of-the-art Dice Similarity Coefficient (DSC) of 85.44% on the Synapse dataset for abdominal organ segmentation and 90.22% on the BraTS2023 dataset for brain tumor segmentation.</p></details> |  |

It is designed to identify and retrieve untrimmed videos that are partially relevant to the provided query. In this work, we investigate long-sequence video content understanding to address information redundancy issues. Leveraging the outstanding long-term state space modeling capability and linear scalability of the Mamba module, we introduce a multi-Mamba module with temporal fusion framework (MamFusion) tailored for PRVR task. This framework effectively captures the state-relatedness in long-term video content and seamlessly integrates it into text-video relevance understanding, thereby enhancing the retrieval process. Specifically, we introduce Temporal T-to-V Fusion and Temporal V-to-T Fusion to explicitly model temporal relationships between text queries and video moments, improving contextual awareness and retrieval accuracy. Extensive experiments conducted on large-scale datasets demonstrate that MamFusion achieves state-of-the-art performance in retrieval effectiveness.

However, existing methods typically rely on transformer-based architectures, which often face challenges related to scalability and efficiency. To address these issues, we propose a novel, efficient human-human interaction generation method based on the Mamba framework, designed to meet the demands of effectively capturing long-sequence dependencies while providing real-time feedback. Specifically, we introduce an adaptive spatio-temporal Mamba framework that utilizes two parallel SSM branches with an adaptive mechanism to integrate the spatial and temporal features of motion sequences. To further enhance the model's ability to capture dependencies within individual motion sequences and the interactions between different individual sequences, we develop two key modules: the self-adaptive spatio-temporal Mamba module and the cross-adaptive spatio-temporal Mamba module, enabling efficient feature learning. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art results on two interaction datasets with remarkable quality and efficiency. Compared to the baseline method InterGen, our approach not only improves accuracy but also requires a minimal parameter size of just 66M ,only 36% of InterGen's, while achieving an average inference speed of 0.57 seconds, which is 46% of InterGen's execution time.</p></details> |  |

This work explores unlocking Mamba's long-context memory ability by a simple-yet-effective method, Recall with Reasoning (RwR), by distilling chain-of-thought (CoT) summarization from a teacher model. Specifically, RwR prepends these summarization as CoT prompts during fine-tuning, teaching Mamba to actively recall and reason over long contexts. Experiments on LONGMEMEVAL and HELMET show RwR boosts Mamba's long-context performance against comparable Transformer/hybrid baselines under similar pretraining conditions, while preserving short-context capabilities, all without architectural changes.</p></details> |  |

However, existing deep learning methods often rely on extensively annotated datasets, which are time-consuming and costly to generate. Self-supervised Learning (SSL) offers a promising alternative by exploiting the abundance of unlabeled data. However, most existing SSL approaches suffer from high computational costs due to convolutional neural networks or transformer-based architectures. Additionally, they struggle to capture long-range dependencies in visual representation and rely on static loss functions that fail to align local and global features effectively. To address these challenges, we propose ConMamba, a novel SSL framework specially designed for PDD. ConMamba integrates the Vision Mamba Encoder (VME), which employs a bidirectional State Space Model (SSM) to capture long-range dependencies efficiently. Furthermore, we introduce a dual-level contrastive loss with dynamic weight adjustment to optimize local-global feature alignment. Experimental results on three benchmark datasets demonstrate that ConMamba significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods across multiple evaluation metrics. This provides an efficient and robust solution for PDD.</p></details> |  |

We investigate mamba-based audio foundation models (MAFMs) for the first time for NVER and hypothesize that MAFMs will outperform attention-based audio foundation models (AAFMs) for NVER by leveraging its state-space modeling to capture intrinsic emotional structures more effectively. Unlike AAFMs, which may amplify irrelevant patterns due to their attention mechanisms, MAFMs will extract more stable and context-aware representations, enabling better differentiation of subtle non-verbal emotional cues. Our experiments with state-of-the-art (SOTA) AAFMs and MAFMs validates our hypothesis. Further, motivated from related research such as speech emotion recognition, synthetic speech detection, where fusion of foundation models (FMs) have showed improved performance, we also explore fusion of FMs for NVER. To this end, we propose, RENO, that uses renyi-divergence as a novel loss function for effective alignment of the FMs. It also makes use of self-attention for better intra-representation interaction of the FMs. With RENO, through the heterogeneous fusion of MAFMs and AAFMs, we show the topmost performance in comparison to individual FMs, its fusion and also setting SOTA in comparison to previous SOTA work.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to EUSIPCO 2025</p></details> |

However, the training methodologies and their potential are still not sufficiently explored. In this paper, we investigate strategies for Vim and propose Stochastic Layer-Wise Shuffle (SLWS), a novel regularization method that can effectively improve the Vim training. Without architectural modifications, this approach enables the non-hierarchical Vim to get leading performance on ImageNet-1K compared with the similar type counterparts. Our method operates through four simple steps per layer: probability allocation to assign layer-dependent shuffle rates, operation sampling via Bernoulli trials, sequence shuffling of input tokens, and order restoration of outputs. SLWS distinguishes itself through three principles: \textit{(1) Plug-and-play:} No architectural modifications are needed, and it is deactivated during inference. \textit{(2) Simple but effective:} The four-step process introduces only random permutations and negligible overhead. \textit{(3) Intuitive design:} Shuffling probabilities grow linearly with layer depth, aligning with the hierarchical semantic abstraction in vision models. Our work underscores the importance of tailored training strategies for Vim models and provides a helpful way to explore their scalability.</p></details> | accpeted to ICML25 |

However, existing approaches face a trade-off: external drafters offer flexibility but can suffer from slower drafting, while self-speculation methods use drafters tailored to the target model but require re-training. In this paper, we introduce novel drafters based on Mamba, a state-of-the-art state space model (SSM), as a solution that combines the best aspects of both approaches. By leveraging the linear structure of SSMs, our approach avoids the quadratic complexity inherent in traditional Transformer-based methods, enabling faster drafting and lower memory usage while maintaining the flexibility to work across different target models. We further enhance efficiency with a novel test-time tree search algorithm for generating high-quality draft candidates. Our empirical evaluation demonstrates that Mamba-based drafters not only outperform existing external drafting methods but are also comparable to state-of-the-art self-speculation approaches while using less memory and maintaining their cross-model adaptability.</p></details> |  |

To address this, the Frequency-Assisted Mamba-Like Linear Attention Network (FMNet) is proposed, which leverages frequency-domain learning to efficiently capture global features and mitigate ambiguity between objects and the background. FMNet introduces the Multi-Scale Frequency-Assisted Mamba-Like Linear Attention (MFM) module, integrating frequency and spatial features through a multi-scale structure to handle scale variations while reducing computational complexity. Additionally, the Pyramidal Frequency Attention Extraction (PFAE) module and the Frequency Reverse Decoder (FRD) enhance semantics and reconstruct features.

While many recent works aim to improve this framework by designing more powerful encoders and decoders, employing advanced convolutional neural networks (CNNs) for local feature extraction, Transformers or state space models (SSMs) such as Mamba for global context modeling, or hybrid combinations of both, these methods often struggle to fully utilize pretrained vision backbones (e.g., ResNet, ViT, VMamba) due to structural mismatches. To bridge this gap, we introduce ACM-UNet, a general-purpose segmentation framework that retains a simple UNet-like design while effectively incorporating pretrained CNNs and Mamba models through a lightweight adapter mechanism. This adapter resolves architectural incompatibilities and enables the model to harness the complementary strengths of CNNs and SSMs-namely, fine-grained local detail extraction and long-range dependency modeling. Additionally, we propose a hierarchical multi-scale wavelet transform module in the decoder to enhance feature fusion and reconstruction fidelity. Extensive experiments on the Synapse and ACDC benchmarks demonstrate that ACM-UNet achieves state-of-the-art performance while remaining computationally efficient.

We rely on theoretical and empirical connections to Transformer-based architectures and their attention mechanisms. Exploiting this relationship, we adapt attentional interpretability techniques originally developed for Transformers--specifically, the Attention Knockout methodology--to both Mamba-1 and Mamba-2. Using them we trace how information is transmitted and localized across tokens and layers, revealing patterns of subject-token information emergence and layer-wise dynamics. Notably, some phenomena vary between mamba models and Transformer based models, while others appear universally across all models inspected--hinting that these may be inherent to LLMs in general. By further leveraging Mamba's structured factorization, we disentangle how distinct "features" either enable token-to-token information exchange or enrich individual tokens, thus offering a unified lens to understand Mamba internal operations.</p></details> | Accepted to ACL 2025 |
| **[Mamba-R: Vision Mamba ALSO Needs Registers](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.14858v2)** | 2025-05-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Similar to Vision Transformers, this paper identifies artifacts also present within the feature maps of Vision Mamba. These artifacts, corresponding to high-norm tokens emerging in low-information background areas of images, appear much more severe in Vision Mamba -- they exist prevalently even with the tiny-sized model and activate extensively across background regions. To mitigate this issue, we follow the prior solution of introducing register tokens into Vision Mamba. To better cope with Mamba blocks' uni-directional inference paradigm, two key modifications are introduced: 1) evenly inserting registers throughout the input token sequence, and 2) recycling registers for final decision predictions. We term this new architecture Mamba-R. Qualitative observations suggest, compared to vanilla Vision Mamba, Mamba-R's feature maps appear cleaner and more focused on semantically meaningful regions. Quantitatively, Mamba-R attains stronger performance and scales better. For example, on the ImageNet benchmark, our base-size Mamba-R attains 83.0% accuracy, significantly outperforming Vim-B's 81.8%; furthermore, we provide the first successful scaling to the large model size (i.e., with 341M parameters), attaining a competitive accuracy of 83.6% (84.5% if finetuned with 384x384 inputs). Additional validation on the downstream semantic segmentation task also supports Mamba-R's efficacy.

A series of works on Mamba has shown its significant potential in various fields, e.g., segmentation and classification. However, the perception capability of Mamba remains under-explored. Consequently, we propose QMamba by revisiting and adapting the Mamba model for three crucial IQA tasks, i.e., task-specific, universal, and transferable IQA, which reveals its clear advantages over existing foundational models, e.g., Swin Transformer, ViT, and CNNs, in terms of perception and computational cost. To improve the transferability of QMamba, we propose the StylePrompt tuning paradigm, where lightweight mean and variance prompts are injected to assist task-adaptive transfer learning of pre-trained QMamba for different downstream IQA tasks. Compared with existing prompt tuning strategies, our StylePrompt enables better perceptual transfer with lower computational cost. Extensive experiments on multiple synthetic, authentic IQA datasets, and cross IQA datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed QMamba.

Existing approaches often rely on long-term training data or focus on short-term sequence correlations, struggling to maintain predictive stability and dynamical coherence over extended horizons. We propose PhyxMamba, a novel framework that integrates a Mamba-based state-space model with physics-informed principles to capture the underlying dynamics of chaotic systems. By reconstructing the attractor manifold from brief observations using time-delay embeddings, PhyxMamba extracts global dynamical features essential for accurate forecasting. Our generative training scheme enables Mamba to replicate the physical process, augmented by multi-token prediction and attractor geometry regularization for physical constraints, enhancing prediction accuracy and preserving key statistical invariants. Extensive evaluations on diverse simulated and real-world chaotic systems demonstrate that PhyxMamba delivers superior long-term forecasting and faithfully captures essential dynamical invariants from short-term data. This framework opens new avenues for reliably predicting chaotic systems under observation-scarce conditions, with broad implications across climate science, neuroscience, epidemiology, and beyond. Our code is open-source at https://github.com/tsinghua-fib-lab/PhyxMamba.</p></details> |  |
| **[Exploring the Limitations of Mamba in COPY and CoT Reasoning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.03810v3)** | 2025-05-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Transformers have become the backbone of modern Large Language Models (LLMs); however, their inference overhead grows linearly with the sequence length, posing challenges for modeling long sequences. In light of this, Mamba has attracted attention for maintaining a constant inference size, with empirical evidence demonstrating that it can match Transformer performance in sequence modeling while significantly reducing computational costs. However, an open question remains: can Mamba always bring savings while achieving performance comparable to Transformers? In this paper, we focus on analyzing the expressive ability of Mamba to perform our defined COPY operation and Chain of Thought (CoT) reasoning. First, inspired by the connection between Mamba and linear attention, we show that constant-sized Mamba may struggle to perform COPY operations while Transformers can handle them more easily. However, when the size of Mamba grows linearly with the input sequence length, it can accurately perform COPY, but in this case, Mamba no longer provides overhead savings. Based on this observation, we further analyze Mamba's ability to tackle CoT tasks, which can be described by the Dynamic Programming (DP) problems. Our findings suggest that to solve arbitrary DP problems, the total cost of Mamba is still comparable to standard Transformers. However, similar to efficient Transformers, when facing DP problems with favorable properties such as locality, Mamba can provide savings in overhead. Our experiments on the copy and CoT tasks further demonstrate Mamba's limitations compared to Transformers in learning these tasks.</p></details> | <details><summary>Mamba...</summary><p>Mamba, Chain of Thought</p></details> |

To address this issue, we propose HTMNet, a novel hybrid model integrating Transformer, CNN, and Mamba architectures. The encoder is based on a dual-branch CNN-Transformer framework, the bottleneck fusion module adopts a Transformer-Mamba architecture, and the decoder is built upon a multi-scale fusion module. We introduce a novel multimodal fusion module grounded in self-attention mechanisms and state space models, marking the first application of the Mamba architecture in the field of transparent object depth completion and revealing its promising potential. Additionally, we design an innovative multi-scale fusion module for the decoder that combines channel attention, spatial attention, and multi-scale feature extraction techniques to effectively integrate multi-scale features through a down-fusion strategy. Extensive evaluations on multiple public datasets demonstrate that our model achieves state-of-the-art(SOTA) performance, validating the effectiveness of our approach.</p></details> |  |

However, existing neural operators struggle with scalability in high-dimensional spaces, incur high computational costs, and face challenges in capturing continuous and long-range dependencies in PDE dynamics. To address these limitations, we introduce the Latent Mamba Operator (LaMO), which integrates the efficiency of state-space models (SSMs) in latent space with the expressive power of kernel integral formulations in neural operators. We also establish a theoretical connection between state-space models (SSMs) and the kernel integral of neural operators. Extensive experiments across diverse PDE benchmarks on regular grids, structured meshes, and point clouds covering solid and fluid physics datasets, LaMOs achieve consistent state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance, with a 32.3% improvement over existing baselines in solution operator approximation, highlighting its efficacy in modeling complex PDE solutions.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proce...</summary><p>Proceedings of the 42 nd International Conference on Machine Learning, Vancouver, Canada.

This paper introduces EVM-Fusion, an Explainable Vision Mamba architecture featuring a novel Neural Algorithmic Fusion (NAF) mechanism for multi-organ medical image classification. EVM-Fusion leverages a multipath design, where DenseNet and U-Net based pathways, enhanced by Vision Mamba (Vim) modules, operate in parallel with a traditional feature pathway. These diverse features are dynamically integrated via a two-stage fusion process: cross-modal attention followed by the iterative NAF block, which learns an adaptive fusion algorithm. Intrinsic explainability is embedded through path-specific spatial attention, Vim {\Delta}-value maps, traditional feature SE-attention, and cross-modal attention weights. Experiments on a diverse 9-class multi-organ medical image dataset demonstrate EVM-Fusion's strong classification performance, achieving 99.75% test accuracy and provide multi-faceted insights into its decision-making process, highlighting its potential for trustworthy AI in medical diagnostics.</p></details> | 14 pages, 4 figures |

Our approach primarily relies on regression-based modeling, which performs well across most distortions. However, for packet loss and bandwidth extension, where missing content must be inferred, a generative variant of the proposed USEMamba proves more effective.

However, existing application strategies are straightforward, utilizing only the final output of the pre-trained model for various task heads. It neglects the rich complementary information in the intermediate layer, thereby failing to fully unlock the potential of pre-trained models. To overcome this limitation, we propose an orthogonal solution: Point Mamba Adapter (PMA), which constructs an ordered feature sequence from all layers of the pre-trained model and leverages Mamba to fuse all complementary semantics, thereby promoting comprehensive point cloud understanding. Constructing this ordered sequence is non-trivial due to the inherent isotropy of 3D space. Therefore, we further propose a geometry-constrained gate prompt generator (G2PG) shared across different layers, which applies shared geometric constraints to the output gates of the Mamba and dynamically optimizes the spatial order, thus enabling more effective integration of multi-layer information. Extensive experiments conducted on challenging point cloud datasets across various tasks demonstrate that our PMA elevates the capability for point cloud understanding to a new level by fusing diverse complementary intermediate features.

| **[Hierarchical Mamba Meets Hyperbolic Geometry: A New Paradigm for Structured Language Embeddings](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.18973v2)** | 2025-05-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Selective state-space models have achieved great success in long-sequence modeling. However, their capacity for language representation, especially in complex hierarchical reasoning tasks, remains underexplored. Most large language models rely on flat Euclidean embeddings, limiting their ability to capture latent hierarchies. To address this limitation, we propose Hierarchical Mamba (HiM), integrating efficient Mamba2 with exponential growth and curved nature of hyperbolic geometry to learn hierarchy-aware language embeddings for deeper linguistic understanding. Mamba2-processed sequences are projected to the Poincare ball (via tangent-based mapping) or Lorentzian manifold (via cosine and sine-based mapping) with "learnable" curvature, optimized with a combined hyperbolic loss. Our HiM model facilitates the capture of relational distances across varying hierarchical levels, enabling effective long-range reasoning. This makes it well-suited for tasks like mixed-hop prediction and multi-hop inference in hierarchical classification. We evaluated our HiM with four linguistic and medical datasets for mixed-hop prediction and multi-hop inference tasks. Experimental results demonstrated that: 1) Both HiM models effectively capture hierarchical relationships for four ontological datasets, surpassing Euclidean baselines. 2) HiM-Poincare captures fine-grained semantic distinctions with higher h-norms, while HiM-Lorentz provides more stable, compact, and hierarchy-preserving embeddings favoring robustness over detail.</p></details> | 10 pages, 3 figures |
| **[Mamba-Driven Topology Fusion for Monocular 3-D Human Pose Estimation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.20611v1)** | 2025-05-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Transformer-based methods for 3-D human pose estimation face significant computational challenges due to the quadratic growth of self-attention mechanism complexity with sequence length. Recently, the Mamba model has substantially reduced computational overhead and demonstrated outstanding performance in modeling long sequences by leveraging state space model (SSM). However, the ability of SSM to process sequential data is not suitable for 3-D joint sequences with topological structures, and the causal convolution structure in Mamba also lacks insight into local joint relationships. To address these issues, we propose the Mamba-Driven Topology Fusion framework in this paper. Specifically, the proposed Bone Aware Module infers the direction and length of bone vectors in the spherical coordinate system, providing effective topological guidance for the Mamba model in processing joint sequences. Furthermore, we enhance the convolutional structure within the Mamba model by integrating forward and backward graph convolutional network, enabling it to better capture local joint dependencies. Finally, we design a Spatiotemporal Refinement Module to model both temporal and spatial relationships within the sequence. Through the incorporation of skeletal topology, our approach effectively alleviates Mamba's limitations in capturing human structural relationships. We conduct extensive experiments on the Human3.6M and MPI-INF-3DHP datasets for testing and comparison, and the results show that the proposed method greatly reduces computational cost while achieving higher accuracy. Ablation studies further demonstrate the effectiveness of each proposed module. The code and models will be released.</p></details> |  |
| **[Stuffed Mamba: Oversized States Lead to the Inability to Forget](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.07145v2)** | 2025-05-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent advancements in recurrent architectures, such as Mamba and RWKV, have showcased strong language capabilities. Unlike transformer-based models, these architectures encode all contextual information into a fixed-size state, leading to great inference efficiency. However, this approach can cause information interference, where different token data conflicts, resulting in performance degradation and incoherent outputs beyond a certain context length. To prevent this, most RNNs incorporate mechanisms designed to "forget" earlier tokens. In this paper, we reveal that Mamba-based models struggle to effectively forget earlier tokens even with built-in forgetting mechanisms. We demonstrate that this issue stems from training on contexts that are too short for the state size, enabling the model to perform well without needing to learn how to forget. Then, we show that the minimum training length required for the model to learn forgetting scales linearly with the state size, and the maximum context length for accurate retrieval of a 5-digit passkey scales exponentially with the state size, indicating that the model retains some information beyond the point where forgetting begins. These findings highlight a critical limitation in current RNN architectures and provide valuable insights for improving long-context modeling. Our work suggests that future RNN designs must account for the interplay between state size, training length, and forgetting mechanisms to achieve robust performance in long-context tasks.</p></details> | 20 pages, 18 figures |

The proposed Mamba-Masking architecture introduces a masking mechanism that directly interacts with the encoded reference signal, enabling adaptive and precisely aligned anti-signal generation-even under rapidly changing, high-frequency conditions, as commonly found in speech. Complementing this, a multi-band segmentation strategy further improves phase alignment across frequency bands. Additionally, we introduce an optimization-driven loss function that provides near-optimal supervisory signals for anti-signal generation. Experimental results demonstrate substantial performance gains, achieving up to 7.2dB improvement in ANC scenarios and 6.2dB in ASC, significantly outperforming existing methods.</p></details> |  |

CL enables prediction on new tasks by incorporating sequential training samples. Building on this connection between CL and sequential modeling, meta-continual learning (MCL) aims to meta-learn an efficient continual learner as a sequence prediction model, with advanced sequence models like Transformers being natural choices. However, despite decent performance, Transformers rely on a linearly growing cache to store all past representations, conflicting with CL's objective of not storing all seen samples and limiting efficiency. In this paper, we focus on meta-learning sequence-prediction-based continual learners without retaining all past representations. While attention-free models with fixed-size hidden states (e.g., Linear Transformers) align with CL's essential goal and efficiency needs, they have shown limited effectiveness in MCL in previous literature. Given Mamba's strong sequence modeling performance and attention-free nature, we explore a key question: Can attention-free models like Mamba perform well on MCL? By formulating Mamba and the SSM for MCL tasks, we propose MambaCL, a meta-learned continual learner. To enhance MambaCL's training, we introduce selectivity regularization, leveraging the connection between Mamba and Transformers to guide its behavior over sequences. Furthermore, we study how Mamba and other models perform across various MCL scenarios through extensive and well-designed experiments. Our results highlight the promising performance and strong generalization of Mamba and attention-free models in MCL, demonstrating its potential for efficient continual learning and adaptation.</p></details> |  |

Traditional single-modality networks, such as CNNs and Transformers, are often limited by computational inefficiency and constrained contextual modeling in 3D settings. We introduce a novel multimodal framework that leverages Mamba and Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks (KAN) as an efficient backbone for long-sequence modeling. Our approach features three key innovations: First, an EGSC (Enhanced Gated Spatial Convolution) module captures spatial information when unfolding 3D images into 1D sequences. Second, we extend Group-Rational KAN (GR-KAN), a Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks variant with rational basis functions, into 3D-Group-Rational KAN (3D-GR-KAN) for 3D medical imaging - its first application in this domain - enabling superior feature representation tailored to volumetric data. Third, a dual-branch text-driven strategy leverages CLIP's text embeddings: one branch swaps one-hot labels for semantic vectors to preserve inter-organ semantic relationships, while the other aligns images with detailed organ descriptions to enhance semantic alignment. Experiments on the Medical Segmentation Decathlon (MSD) and KiTS23 datasets show our method achieving state-of-the-art performance, surpassing existing approaches in accuracy and efficiency. This work highlights the power of combining advanced sequence modeling, extended network architectures, and vision-language synergy to push forward 3D medical image segmentation, delivering a scalable solution for clinical use.

It involves inserting an array of electrodes inside the cochlea to electrically stimulate the auditory nerve and restore hearing sensation. A crucial step in this procedure is mastoidectomy, a surgical intervention that removes part of the mastoid region of the temporal bone, providing a critical pathway to the cochlea for electrode placement. Accurate prediction of the mastoidectomy region from preoperative imaging assists presurgical planning, reduces surgical risks, and improves surgical outcomes. In previous work, a self-supervised network was introduced to predict the mastoidectomy region using only preoperative CT scans. While promising, the method suffered from suboptimal robustness, limiting its practical application. To address this limitation, we propose a novel weakly-supervised Mamba-based framework to predict accurate mastoidectomy regions directly from preoperative CT scans. Our approach utilizes a 3D T-Distribution loss function inspired by the Student-t distribution, which effectively handles the complex geometric variability inherent in mastoidectomy shapes. Weak supervision is achieved using the segmentation results from the prior self-supervised network to eliminate the need for manual data cleaning or labeling throughout the training process. The proposed method is extensively evaluated against state-of-the-art approaches, demonstrating superior performance in predicting accurate and clinically relevant mastoidectomy regions. Our findings highlight the robustness and efficiency of the weakly-supervised learning framework with the proposed novel 3D T-Distribution loss.</p></details> |  |

Additionally, we introduce a progressive layer-wise loss, supervising the network at intermediate stages and promoting robust feature extraction throughout the decoding process. Comprehensive experiments across a range of linear codes demonstrate that our method significantly outperforms Transformer-only decoders and standard Mamba models.</p></details> |  |

These networks can leverage the scalability of Transformers while capitalizing on Mamba's strengths in long-context modeling and computational efficiency. However, the challenge of effectively pretraining such hybrid networks remains an open question. Existing methods, such as Masked Autoencoders (MAE) or autoregressive (AR) pretraining, primarily focus on single-type network architectures. In contrast, pretraining strategies for hybrid architectures must be effective for both Mamba and Transformer components. Based on this, we propose Masked Autoregressive Pretraining (MAP) to pretrain a hybrid Mamba-Transformer vision backbone network. This strategy combines the strengths of both MAE and Autoregressive pretraining, improving the performance of Mamba and Transformer modules within a unified paradigm. Experimental results show that the hybrid Mamba-Transformer vision backbone network pretrained with MAP significantly outperforms other pretraining strategies, achieving state-of-the-art performance. We validate the method's effectiveness on both 2D and 3D datasets and provide detailed ablation studies to support the design choices for each component.

The proposed GMamba block integrates Message Passing, Graph Scanning & Flattening, and feature aggregation via a Bidirectional State Space Model (Bi-SSM), achieving Transformer-level performance with 7* fewer FLOPs. By leveraging the complementary strengths of lightweight GNNs and Mamba, the WSI-GMamba framework delivers a scalable solution for large-scale WSI analysis, offering both high accuracy and computational efficiency for slide-level classification.</p></details> |  |

Recently, various deep-learning models have been proposed to enhance medical image segmentation. One promising approach utilizes Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks (KANs), which better capture non-linearity in input data. However, they are unable to effectively capture long-range dependencies, which are required to accurately segment complex medical images and, by that, improve diagnostic accuracy in clinical settings. Neural networks such as Mamba can handle long-range dependencies. However, they have a limited ability to accurately capture non-linearities in the images as compared to KANs. Thus, we propose a novel architecture, the KAN-Mamba FusionNet, which improves segmentation accuracy by effectively capturing the non-linearities from input and handling long-range dependencies with the newly proposed KAMBA block. We evaluated the proposed KAN-Mamba FusionNet on three distinct medical image segmentation datasets: BUSI, Kvasir-Seg, and GlaS - and found it consistently outperforms state-of-the-art methods in IoU and F1 scores. Further, we examined the effects of various components and assessed their contributions to the overall model performance via ablation studies. The findings highlight the effectiveness of this methodology for reliable medical image segmentation, providing a unique approach to address intricate visual data issues in healthcare.</p></details> | <details><summary>11 pa...</summary><p>11 pages, 2 figures, 4 tables</p></details> |

Hunyuan-TurboS features an adaptive long-short chain-of-thought (CoT) mechanism, dynamically switching between rapid responses for simple queries and deep "thinking" modes for complex problems, optimizing computational resources. Architecturally, this 56B activated (560B total) parameter model employs 128 layers (Mamba2, Attention, FFN) with an innovative AMF/MF block pattern. Faster Mamba2 ensures linear complexity, Grouped-Query Attention minimizes KV cache, and FFNs use an MoE structure. Pre-trained on 16T high-quality tokens, it supports a 256K context length and is the first industry-deployed large-scale Mamba model. Our comprehensive post-training strategy enhances capabilities via Supervised Fine-Tuning (3M instructions), a novel Adaptive Long-short CoT Fusion method, Multi-round Deliberation Learning for iterative improvement, and a two-stage Large-scale Reinforcement Learning process targeting STEM and general instruction-following. Evaluations show strong performance: overall top 7 rank on LMSYS Chatbot Arena with a score of 1356, outperforming leading models like Gemini-2.0-Flash-001 (1352) and o4-mini-2025-04-16 (1345).

While existing approaches predict future motion states with the extracted scene context feature from historical agent trajectories and road layouts, they suffer from the information degradation during the scene feature encoding. To address the limitation, we propose HAMF, a novel motion forecasting framework that learns future motion representations with the scene context encoding jointly, to coherently combine the scene understanding and future motion state prediction. We first embed the observed agent states and map information into 1D token sequences, together with the target multi-modal future motion features as a set of learnable tokens. Then we design a unified Attention-based encoder, which synergistically combines self-attention and cross-attention mechanisms to model the scene context information and aggregate future motion features jointly. Complementing the encoder, we implement the Mamba module in the decoding stage to further preserve the consistency and correlations among the learned future motion representations, to generate the accurate and diverse final trajectories. Extensive experiments on Argoverse 2 benchmark demonstrate that our hybrid Attention-Mamba model achieves state-of-the-art motion forecasting performance with the simple and lightweight architecture.</p></details> | In submission |

While computer-assisted surgery (CAS) systems enhance ESD precision and safety, their efficacy hinges on accurate real-time surgical phase recognition, a task complicated by ESD's inherent complexity, including heterogeneous lesion characteristics and dynamic tissue interactions. Existing video-based phase recognition algorithms, constrained by inefficient temporal context modeling, exhibit limited performance in capturing fine-grained phase transitions and long-range dependencies. To overcome these limitations, we propose SPRMamba, a novel framework integrating a Mamba-based architecture with a Scaled Residual TranMamba (SRTM) block to synergize long-term temporal modeling and localized detail extraction. SPRMamba further introduces the Hierarchical Sampling Strategy to optimize computational efficiency, enabling real-time processing critical for clinical deployment. Evaluated on the ESD385 dataset and the cholecystectomy benchmark Cholec80, SPRMamba achieves state-of-the-art performance (87.64% accuracy on ESD385, +1.0% over prior methods), demonstrating robust generalizability across surgical workflows. This advancement bridges the gap between computational efficiency and temporal sensitivity, offering a transformative tool for intraoperative guidance and skill assessment in ESD surgery.

State Space Sequence Models (SSMs) have demonstrated promise in modeling long-range dependencies with linear computational complexity, yet their application in medical image segmentation remains hindered by incompatibilities with image tokens and autoregressive assumptions. Moreover, it is difficult to achieve a balance in capturing both local fine-grained information and global semantic dependencies. To address these challenges, we introduce SAMA-UNet, a novel architecture for medical image segmentation. A key innovation is the Self-Adaptive Mamba-like Aggregated Attention (SAMA) block, which integrates contextual self-attention with dynamic weight modulation to prioritise the most relevant features based on local and global contexts. This approach reduces computational complexity and improves the representation of complex image features across multiple scales. We also suggest the Causal-Resonance Multi-Scale Module (CR-MSM), which enhances the flow of information between the encoder and decoder by using causal resonance learning. This mechanism allows the model to automatically adjust feature resolution and causal dependencies across scales, leading to better semantic alignment between the low-level and high-level features in U-shaped architectures. Experiments on MRI, CT, and endoscopy images show that SAMA-UNet performs better in segmentation accuracy than current methods using CNN, Transformer, and Mamba. The implementation is publicly available at GitHub.</p></details> |  |

However, its application to optical flow estimation remains unexplored. In this paper, we introduce MambaFlow, a novel framework designed to leverage the high accuracy and efficiency of the Mamba architecture for capturing locally correlated features while preserving global information in end-to-end optical flow estimation. To our knowledge, MambaFlow is the first architecture centered around the Mamba design tailored specifically for optical flow estimation. It comprises two key components: (1) PolyMamba, which optimizes feature representation; and (2) PulseMamba, which facilitates efficient flow information dissemination. Our extensive experiments demonstrate that MambaFlow achieves remarkable results. On the Sintel benchmark, MambaFlow records an endpoint error (EPE) of 1.43 and an inference speed of 0.113 seconds, surpassing the state-of-the-art methods including GMFlow (with 18.9% lower EPE and 18.1% faster inference), SeparableFlow (5% lower EPE and 50.5% faster), CRAFT (1.11% lower EPE and 76.5% faster), and DIP (0.7% lower EPE and 77.2% faster)-demonstrating stronger potential for real-world deployment on resource-constrained devices.

Despite its significance, existing methods face substantial limitation in achieving choreographic consistency. To address the challenge, we propose MatchDance, a novel framework for music-to-dance generation that constructs a latent representation to enhance choreographic consistency. MatchDance employs a two-stage design: (1) a Kinematic-Dynamic-based Quantization Stage (KDQS), which encodes dance motions into a latent representation by Finite Scalar Quantization (FSQ) with kinematic-dynamic constraints and reconstructs them with high fidelity, and (2) a Hybrid Music-to-Dance Generation Stage(HMDGS), which uses a Mamba-Transformer hybrid architecture to map music into the latent representation, followed by the KDQS decoder to generate 3D dance motions. Additionally, a music-dance retrieval framework and comprehensive metrics are introduced for evaluation. Extensive experiments on the FineDance dataset demonstrate state-of-the-art performance.

While current Transformer-based methods leverage dense text information to maintain model robustness, their quadratic complexity hinders efficient long-range modeling and multimodal fusion. To this end, we propose a novel and efficient Text-enhanced Fusion Mamba (TF-Mamba) framework for robust MSA with missing modalities. Specifically, a Text-aware Modality Enhancement (TME) module aligns and enriches non-text modalities, while reconstructing the missing text semantics. Moreover, we develop Text-based Context Mamba (TC-Mamba) to capture intra-modal contextual dependencies under text collaboration. Finally, Text-guided Query Mamba (TQ-Mamba) queries text-guided multimodal information and learns joint representations for sentiment prediction.

However, its adaptation to visual inputs is hindered by challenges in 2D-to-1D patch serialization and weak scalability across input resolutions. Existing serialization strategies such as raster scanning disrupt local spatial continuity and limit the model's ability to generalize across scales. In this paper, we propose FractalMamba++, a robust vision backbone that leverages fractal-based patch serialization via Hilbert curves to preserve spatial locality and enable seamless resolution adaptability. To address long-range dependency fading in high-resolution inputs, we further introduce a Cross-State Routing (CSR) mechanism that enhances global context propagation through selective state reuse. Additionally, we propose a Positional-Relation Capture (PRC) module to recover local adjacency disrupted by curve inflection points. Extensive experiments on image classification, semantic segmentation, object detection, and change detection demonstrate that FractalMamba++ consistently outperforms previous Mamba-based backbones, particularly under high-resolution settings.</p></details> | Work in progressing |

However, most methods enhance the global receptive field by directly modifying the scanning mode of Mamba, neglecting the crucial role that local information plays in dense prediction tasks (e.g., binary CD). In this article, we propose a model called CDMamba, which effectively combines global and local features for handling binary CD tasks. Specifically, the Scaled Residual ConvMamba (SRCM) block is proposed to utilize the ability of Mamba to extract global features and convolution to enhance the local details to alleviate the issue that current Mamba-based methods lack detailed clues and are difficult to achieve fine detection in dense prediction tasks. Furthermore, considering the characteristics of bi-temporal feature interaction required for CD, the Adaptive Global Local Guided Fusion (AGLGF) block is proposed to dynamically facilitate the bi-temporal interaction guided by other temporal global/local features. Our intuition is that more discriminative change features can be acquired with the guidance of other temporal features. Extensive experiments on five datasets demonstrate that our proposed CDMamba is comparable to the current methods (such as the F1/IoU scores are improved by 2.10%/3.00% and 2.44%/2.91% on LEVIR+CD and CLCD, respectively).

This limitation hinders performance in long-horizon sequential manipulation tasks where the correct action depends on past events not fully captured by the current state. To address this fundamental challenge, we introduce Mamba Temporal Imitation Learning (MTIL), a novel approach that leverages the recurrent state dynamics inherent in State Space Models (SSMs), specifically the Mamba architecture. MTIL encodes the entire trajectory history into a compressed hidden state, conditioning action predictions on this comprehensive temporal context alongside current multi-modal observations. Through extensive experiments on simulated benchmarks (ACT dataset tasks, Robomimic, LIBERO) and real-world sequential manipulation tasks specifically designed to probe temporal dependencies, MTIL significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods like ACT and Diffusion Policy. Our findings affirm the necessity of full temporal context for robust sequential decision-making and validate MTIL as a powerful approach that transcends the inherent limitations of Markovian imitation learning</p></details> | <details><summary>16 pa...</summary><p>16 pages,6 figures,Submitted to IEEE RAL</p></details> |

Existing methods like the Anomaly Transformer and DCdetector have progressed, but they face limitations such as sensitivity to short-term contexts and inefficiency in noisy, non-stationary environments. To overcome these issues, we introduce MAAT, an improved architecture that enhances association discrepancy modeling and reconstruction quality. MAAT features Sparse Attention, efficiently capturing long-range dependencies by focusing on relevant time steps, thereby reducing computational redundancy. Additionally, a Mamba-Selective State Space Model is incorporated into the reconstruction module, utilizing a skip connection and Gated Attention to improve anomaly localization and detection performance. Extensive experiments show that MAAT significantly outperforms previous methods, achieving better anomaly distinguishability and generalization across various time series applications, setting a new standard for unsupervised time series anomaly detection in real-world scenarios.</p></details> |  |

Recent NOs are dominated by the Transformer architecture, which offers NOs the capability to capture long-range dependencies in PDE dynamics. However, existing Transformer-based NOs suffer from quadratic complexity, lack geometric rigor, and thus suffer from sub-optimal performance on regular grids. As a remedy, we propose the Geometric Mamba Neural Operator (GeoMaNO) framework, which empowers NOs with Mamba's modeling capability, linear complexity, plus geometric rigor. We evaluate GeoMaNO's performance on multiple standard and popularly employed PDE benchmarks, spanning from Darcy flow problems to Navier-Stokes problems. GeoMaNO improves existing baselines in solution operator approximation by as much as 58.9%.</p></details> |  |

However, CNNs are constrained by limited receptive fields, while Transformers suffer from scalability challenges due to their quadratic computational complexity. To address these limitations, recent advances have explored alternative architectures. The state-space model Mamba offers near-linear complexity while capturing long-range dependencies, and the Kolmogorov-Arnold Network (KAN) enhances nonlinear expressiveness by replacing fixed activation functions with learnable ones. Building on these strengths, we propose MedVKAN, an efficient feature extraction model integrating Mamba and KAN. Specifically, we introduce the EFC-KAN module, which enhances KAN with convolutional operations to improve local pixel interaction. We further design the VKAN module, integrating Mamba with EFC-KAN as a replacement for Transformer modules, significantly improving feature extraction. Extensive experiments on five public medical image segmentation datasets show that MedVKAN achieves state-of-the-art performance on four datasets and ranks second on the remaining one. These results validate the potential of Mamba and KAN for medical image segmentation while introducing an innovative and computationally efficient feature extraction framework.

However, learning a robust world model often requires complex and deep architectures, which are computationally expensive and challenging to train. Within the world model, sequence models play a critical role in accurate predictions, and various architectures have been explored, each with its own challenges. Currently, recurrent neural network (RNN)-based world models struggle with vanishing gradients and capturing long-term dependencies. Transformers, on the other hand, suffer from the quadratic memory and computational complexity of self-attention mechanisms, scaling as $O(n^2)$, where $n$ is the sequence length. To address these challenges, we propose a state space model (SSM)-based world model, Drama, specifically leveraging Mamba, that achieves $O(n)$ memory and computational complexity while effectively capturing long-term dependencies and enabling efficient training with longer sequences. We also introduce a novel sampling method to mitigate the suboptimality caused by an incorrect world model in the early training stages. Combining these techniques, Drama achieves a normalised score on the Atari100k benchmark that is competitive with other state-of-the-art (SOTA) model-based RL algorithms, using only a 7 million-parameter world model. Drama is accessible and trainable on off-the-shelf hardware, such as a standard laptop.

While recent transformer-based approaches have shown promising results for short-term dyadic motion synthesis, they struggle with longer sequences due to inherent limitations in positional encoding schemes. In this paper, we introduce Dyadic Mamba, a novel approach that leverages State-Space Models (SSMs) to generate high-quality dyadic human motion of arbitrary length. Our method employs a simple yet effective architecture that facilitates information flow between individual motion sequences through concatenation, eliminating the need for complex cross-attention mechanisms.

If comparable volumes could be generated directly from widely available scalp electroencephalography (EEG), advanced neuroimaging would become significantly more accessible. Existing EEG-to-fMRI generators rely on plain CNNs that fail to capture cross-channel time-frequency cues or on heavy transformer/GAN decoders that strain memory and stability. We propose Spec2VolCAMU-Net, a lightweight spectrogram-to-volume generator that confronts these issues via a Multi-directional Time-Frequency Convolutional Attention Encoder, stacking temporal, spectral and joint convolutions with self-attention, and a Vision-Mamba U-Net decoder whose linear-time state-space blocks enable efficient long-range spatial modelling. Trained end-to-end with a hybrid SSI-MSE loss, Spec2VolCAMU-Net achieves state-of-the-art fidelity on three public benchmarks, recording SSIMs of 0.693 on NODDI, 0.725 on Oddball and 0.788 on CN-EPFL, representing improvements of 14.5%, 14.9%, and 16.9% respectively over previous best SSIM scores. Furthermore, it achieves competitive PSNR scores, particularly excelling on the CN-EPFL dataset with a 4.6% improvement over the previous best PSNR, thus striking a better balance in reconstruction quality.

However, an aspiration needle tracker addressing rapid reciprocating motion is still missing. MrTrack, an aspiration needle tracker with a mamba-based register mechanism, is proposed. MrTrack leverages a Mamba-based register extractor to sequentially distill global context from each historical search map, storing these temporal cues in a register bank. The Mamba-based register retriever then retrieves temporal prompts from the register bank to provide external cues when current vision features are temporarily unusable due to rapid reciprocating motion and imaging degradation. A self-supervised register diversify loss is proposed to encourage feature diversity and dimension independence within the learned register, mitigating feature collapse. Comprehensive experiments conducted on both motorized and manual aspiration datasets demonstrate that MrTrack not only outperforms state-of-the-art trackers in accuracy and robustness but also achieves superior inference efficiency.</p></details> | <details><summary>Early...</summary><p>Early Accepted by MICCAI 2025</p></details> |

Existing approaches predominantly rely on traditional models, including RNNs and Transformers. Despite their success in local pattern recognition, Transformer-based methods suffer from quadratic computational complexity and a tendency toward superficial attention patterns, limiting their ability to infer enduring preference hierarchies in sequential recommendation data. Recent advances in Mamba-based sequential models introduce linear-time efficiency but remain constrained by Euclidean geometry, failing to leverage the intrinsic hyperbolic structure of recommendation data. To bridge this gap, we propose Hyperbolic Mamba, a novel architecture that unifies the efficiency of Mamba's selective state space mechanism with hyperbolic geometry's hierarchical representational power. Our framework introduces (1) a hyperbolic selective state space that maintains curvature-aware sequence modeling and (2) stabilized Riemannian operations to enable scalable training. Experiments across four benchmarks demonstrate that Hyperbolic Mamba achieves 3-11% improvement while retaining Mamba's linear-time efficiency, enabling real-world deployment. This work establishes a new paradigm for efficient, hierarchy-aware sequential modeling.</p></details> |  |

However, a surprising weakness remains: despite being built on architectures designed for long-range dependencies, Mamba performs poorly on long-range sequential tasks. Understanding and addressing this gap is important for improving Mamba's universality and versatility. In this work, we analyze Mamba's limitations through three perspectives: expressiveness, inductive bias, and training stability. Our theoretical results show how Mamba falls short in each of these aspects compared to earlier SSMs such as S4D. To address these issues, we propose $\text{B}_2\text{S}_6$, a simple extension of Mamba's S6 unit that combines block-wise selective dynamics with a channel-specific bias. We prove that these changes equip the model with a better-suited inductive bias and improve its expressiveness and stability. Empirically, $\text{B}_2\text{S}_6$ outperforms S4 and S4D on Long-Range Arena (LRA) tasks while maintaining Mamba's performance on language modeling benchmarks.</p></details> |  |

This survey provides a comprehensive review of SSMs, tracing their evolution from the foundational S4 model to its successors like Mamba, Simplified Structured State Space Sequence Model (S5), and Jamba, highlighting their improvements in computational efficiency, memory optimization, and inference speed. By comparing SSMs with traditional sequence models across domains such as natural language processing (NLP), speech recognition, vision, and time-series forecasting, we demonstrate their advantages in handling long-range dependencies while reducing computational overhead. Despite their potential, challenges remain in areas such as training optimization, hybrid modeling, and interpretability.

However, existing methods are facing several limitations: firstly, prior models use transformers to capture the contextual dependencies, which requires quadratic computation resulting in low efficiency in the inference stage. Secondly, prior works typically rely on frequencysupervised methods to estimate the fundamental frequency (f0), which ignores that the musical performance is actually based on notes. Thirdly, transformers typically require large amounts of labeled data to achieve optimal performances, but the SME task lacks of sufficient annotated data. To address these issues, in this paper, we propose a mamba-based network, called SpectMamba, for semi-supervised singing melody extraction using confidence binary regularization. In particular, we begin by introducing vision mamba to achieve computational linear complexity. Then, we propose a novel note-f0 decoder that allows the model to better mimic the musical performance. Further, to alleviate the scarcity of the labeled data, we introduce a confidence binary regularization (CBR) module to leverage the unlabeled data by maximizing the probability of the correct classes. The proposed method is evaluated on several public datasets and the conducted experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed method.</p></details> |  |

We propose a novel unstructured pruning framework tailored for Mamba models that achieves up to 70\% parameter reduction while retaining over 95\% of the original performance. Our approach integrates three key innovations: (1) a gradient-aware magnitude pruning technique that combines weight magnitude and gradient information to identify less critical parameters, (2) an iterative pruning schedule that gradually increases sparsity to maintain model stability, and (3) a global pruning strategy that optimizes parameter allocation across the entire model. Through extensive experiments on WikiText-103, Long Range Arena, and ETT time-series benchmarks, we demonstrate significant efficiency gains with minimal performance degradation.

While transformer-based models have shown promise in capturing long-range dependencies in temporal graph data, they face scalability challenges due to quadratic computational complexity. This study presents a comparative analysis of dynamic graph embedding approaches using transformers and the recently proposed Mamba architecture, a state-space model with linear complexity. We introduce three novel models: TransformerG2G augment with graph convolutional networks, \mathcal{DG}-Mamba, and \mathcal{GDG}-Mamba with graph isomorphism network edge convolutions. Our experiments on multiple benchmark datasets demonstrate that Mamba-based models achieve comparable or superior performance to transformer-based approaches in link prediction tasks while offering significant computational efficiency gains on longer sequences. Notably, \mathcal{DG}-Mamba variants consistently outperform transformer-based models on datasets with high temporal variability, such as UCI, Bitcoin, and Reality Mining, while maintaining competitive performance on more stable graphs like SBM. We provide insights into the learned temporal dependencies through analysis of attention weights and state matrices, revealing the models' ability to capture complex temporal patterns. By effectively combining state-space models with graph neural networks, our work addresses key limitations of previous approaches and contributes to the growing body of research on efficient temporal graph representation learning. These findings offer promising directions for scaling dynamic graph embedding to larger, more complex real-world networks, potentially enabling new applications in areas such as social network analysis, financial modeling, and biological system dynamics.</p></details> | 18 pages, 6 figures |

However, it often faces the issue of over-smoothing as the model depth increases, which causes all node representations to converge to a single value and become indistinguishable. This issue stems from the inherent limitations of GNNs, which struggle to distinguish the importance of information from different neighborhoods. In this paper, we introduce MbaGCN, a novel graph convolutional architecture that draws inspiration from the Mamba paradigm-originally designed for sequence modeling. MbaGCN presents a new backbone for GNNs, consisting of three key components: the Message Aggregation Layer, the Selective State Space Transition Layer, and the Node State Prediction Layer. These components work in tandem to adaptively aggregate neighborhood information, providing greater flexibility and scalability for deep GNN models. While MbaGCN may not consistently outperform all existing methods on each dataset, it provides a foundational framework that demonstrates the effective integration of the Mamba paradigm into graph representation learning. Through extensive experiments on benchmark datasets, we demonstrate that MbaGCN paves the way for future advancements in graph neural network research.</p></details> | 11 pages, 4 figures |

However, over-reliance on image enhancement, limited high-quality nighttime data, and a lack of integration between daytime and nighttime trackers hinder the development of an end-to-end trainable framework. Additionally, current ViT-based trackers demand heavy computational resources due to their reliance on the self-attention mechanism. In this paper, we propose a novel pure Mamba-based tracking framework (MambaNUT) that employs a state space model with linear complexity as its backbone, incorporating a single-stream architecture that integrates feature learning and template-search coupling within Vision Mamba. We introduce an adaptive curriculum learning (ACL) approach that dynamically adjusts sampling strategies and loss weights, thereby improving the model's ability of generalization. Our ACL is composed of two levels of curriculum schedulers: (1) sampling scheduler that transforms the data distribution from imbalanced to balanced, as well as from easier (daytime) to harder (nighttime) samples; (2) loss scheduler that dynamically assigns weights based on the size of the training set and IoU of individual instances. Exhaustive experiments on multiple nighttime UAV tracking benchmarks demonstrate that the proposed MambaNUT achieves state-of-the-art performance while requiring lower computational costs. The code will be available at https://github.com/wuyou3474/MambaNUT.</p></details> |  |
| **[Topo-VM-UNetV2: Encoding Topology into Vision Mamba UNet for Polyp Segmentation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.06210v1)** | 2025-05-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Convolutional neural network (CNN) and Transformer-based architectures are two dominant deep learning models for polyp segmentation. However, CNNs have limited capability for modeling long-range dependencies, while Transformers incur quadratic computational complexity. Recently, State Space Models such as Mamba have been recognized as a promising approach for polyp segmentation because they not only model long-range interactions effectively but also maintain linear computational complexity. However, Mamba-based architectures still struggle to capture topological features (e.g., connected components, loops, voids), leading to inaccurate boundary delineation and polyp segmentation. To address these limitations, we propose a new approach called Topo-VM-UNetV2, which encodes topological features into the Mamba-based state-of-the-art polyp segmentation model, VM-UNetV2. Our method consists of two stages: Stage 1: VM-UNetV2 is used to generate probability maps (PMs) for the training and test images, which are then used to compute topology attention maps. Specifically, we first compute persistence diagrams of the PMs, then we generate persistence score maps by assigning persistence values (i.e., the difference between death and birth times) of each topological feature to its birth location, finally we transform persistence scores into attention weights using the sigmoid function. Stage 2: These topology attention maps are integrated into the semantics and detail infusion (SDI) module of VM-UNetV2 to form a topology-guided semantics and detail infusion (Topo-SDI) module for enhancing the segmentation results. Extensive experiments on five public polyp segmentation datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed method. The code will be made publicly available.</p></details> |  |
| **[M2Rec: Multi-scale Mamba for Efficient Sequential Recommendation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.04445v1)** | 2025-05-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Sequential recommendation systems aim to predict users' next preferences based on their interaction histories, but existing approaches face critical limitations in efficiency and multi-scale pattern recognition. While Transformer-based methods struggle with quadratic computational complexity, recent Mamba-based models improve efficiency but fail to capture periodic user behaviors, leverage rich semantic information, or effectively fuse multimodal features. To address these challenges, we propose \model, a novel sequential recommendation framework that integrates multi-scale Mamba with Fourier analysis, Large Language Models (LLMs), and adaptive gating. First, we enhance Mamba with Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) to explicitly model periodic patterns in the frequency domain, separating meaningful trends from noise. Second, we incorporate LLM-based text embeddings to enrich sparse interaction data with semantic context from item descriptions. Finally, we introduce a learnable gate mechanism to dynamically balance temporal (Mamba), frequency (FFT), and semantic (LLM) features, ensuring harmonious multimodal fusion. Extensive experiments demonstrate that \model\ achieves state-of-the-art performance, improving Hit Rate@10 by 3.2\% over existing Mamba-based models while maintaining 20\% faster inference than Transformer baselines. Our results highlight the effectiveness of combining frequency analysis, semantic understanding, and adaptive fusion for sequential recommendation.

| **[WDMamba: When Wavelet Degradation Prior Meets Vision Mamba for Image Dehazing](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.04369v1)** | 2025-05-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In this paper, we reveal a novel haze-specific wavelet degradation prior observed through wavelet transform analysis, which shows that haze-related information predominantly resides in low-frequency components. Exploiting this insight, we propose a novel dehazing framework, WDMamba, which decomposes the image dehazing task into two sequential stages: low-frequency restoration followed by detail enhancement. This coarse-to-fine strategy enables WDMamba to effectively capture features specific to each stage of the dehazing process, resulting in high-quality restored images. Specifically, in the low-frequency restoration stage, we integrate Mamba blocks to reconstruct global structures with linear complexity, efficiently removing overall haze and producing a coarse restored image. Thereafter, the detail enhancement stage reinstates fine-grained information that may have been overlooked during the previous phase, culminating in the final dehazed output. Furthermore, to enhance detail retention and achieve more natural dehazing, we introduce a self-guided contrastive regularization during network training. By utilizing the coarse restored output as a hard negative example, our model learns more discriminative representations, substantially boosting the overall dehazing performance. Extensive evaluations on public dehazing benchmarks demonstrate that our method surpasses state-of-the-art approaches both qualitatively and quantitatively. Code is available at https://github.com/SunJ000/WDMamba.</p></details> |  |
| **[DA-Mamba: Domain Adaptive Hybrid Mamba-Transformer Based One-Stage Object Detection](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.11178v2)** | 2025-05-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent 2D CNN-based domain adaptation approaches struggle with long-range dependencies due to limited receptive fields, making it difficult to adapt to target domains with significant spatial distribution changes. While transformer-based domain adaptation methods better capture distant relationships through self-attention mechanisms that facilitate more effective cross-domain feature alignment, their quadratic computational complexity makes practical deployment challenging for object detection tasks across diverse domains. Inspired by the global modeling and linear computation complexity of the Mamba architecture, we present the first domain-adaptive Mamba-based one-stage object detection model, termed DA-Mamba. Specifically, we combine Mamba's efficient state-space modeling with attention mechanisms to address domain-specific spatial and channel-wise variations. Our design leverages domain-adaptive spatial and channel-wise scanning within the Mamba block to extract highly transferable representations for efficient sequential processing, while cross-attention modules generate long-range, mixed-domain spatial features to enable robust soft alignment across domains. Besides, motivated by the observation that hybrid architectures introduce feature noise in domain adaptation tasks, we propose an entropy-based knowledge distillation framework with margin ReLU, which adaptively refines multi-level representations by suppressing irrelevant activations and aligning uncertainty across source and target domains. Finally, to prevent overfitting caused by the mixed-up features generated through cross-attention mechanisms, we propose entropy-driven gating attention with random perturbations that simultaneously refine target features and enhance model generalization.</p></details> |  |
| **[OSMamba: Omnidirectional Spectral Mamba with Dual-Domain Prior Generator for Exposure Correction](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.15255v2)** | 2025-05-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Exposure correction is a fundamental problem in computer vision and image processing. Recently, frequency domain-based methods have achieved impressive improvement, yet they still struggle with complex real-world scenarios under extreme exposure conditions. This is due to the local convolutional receptive fields failing to model long-range dependencies in the spectrum, and the non-generative learning paradigm being inadequate for retrieving lost details from severely degraded regions. In this paper, we propose Omnidirectional Spectral Mamba (OSMamba), a novel exposure correction network that incorporates the advantages of state space models and generative diffusion models to address these limitations. Specifically, OSMamba introduces an omnidirectional spectral scanning mechanism that adapts Mamba to the frequency domain to capture comprehensive long-range dependencies in both the amplitude and phase spectra of deep image features, hence enhancing illumination correction and structure recovery. Furthermore, we develop a dual-domain prior generator that learns from well-exposed images to generate a degradation-free diffusion prior containing correct information about severely under- and over-exposed regions for better detail restoration. Extensive experiments on multiple-exposure and mixed-exposure datasets demonstrate that the proposed OSMamba achieves state-of-the-art performance both quantitatively and qualitatively.</p></details> |  |
| **[Mamba-Diffusion Model with Learnable Wavelet for Controllable Symbolic Music Generation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.03314v1)** | 2025-05-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The recent surge in the popularity of diffusion models for image synthesis has attracted new attention to their potential for generation tasks in other domains. However, their applications to symbolic music generation remain largely under-explored because symbolic music is typically represented as sequences of discrete events and standard diffusion models are not well-suited for discrete data. We represent symbolic music as image-like pianorolls, facilitating the use of diffusion models for the generation of symbolic music. Moreover, this study introduces a novel diffusion model that incorporates our proposed Transformer-Mamba block and learnable wavelet transform. Classifier-free guidance is utilised to generate symbolic music with target chords. Our evaluation shows that our method achieves compelling results in terms of music quality and controllability, outperforming the strong baseline in pianoroll generation.

State Space Models (SSMs), particularly the recently proposed Mamba architecture, have emerged as a paradigm-shifting solution, combining linear computational scaling with global context modeling. This survey presents a comprehensive review of Mamba-based methodologies in remote sensing, systematically analyzing about 120 Mamba-based remote sensing studies to construct a holistic taxonomy of innovations and applications.

| **[MDDFNet: Mamba-based Dynamic Dual Fusion Network for Traffic Sign Detection](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.05491v1)** | 2025-05-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The Detection of small objects, especially traffic signs, is a critical sub-task in object detection and autonomous driving. Despite signficant progress in previous research, two main challenges remain. First, the issue of feature extraction being too singular. Second, the detection process struggles to efectively handle objects of varying sizes or scales. These problems are also prevalent in general object detection tasks. To address these challenges, we propose a novel object detection network, Mamba-based Dynamic Dual Fusion Network (MDDFNet), for traffic sign detection. The network integrates a dynamic dual fusion module and a Mamba-based backbone to simultaneously tackle the aforementioned issues. Specifically, the dynamic dual fusion module utilizes multiple branches to consolidate various spatial and semantic information, thus enhancing feature diversity. The Mamba-based backbone leverages global feature fusion and local feature interaction, combining features in an adaptive manner to generate unique classification characteristics. Extensive experiments conducted on the TT100K (Tsinghua-Tencent 100K) datasets demonstrate that MDDFNet outperforms other state-of-the-art detectors, maintaining real-time processing capabilities of single-stage models while achieving superior performance. This confirms the efectiveness of MDDFNet in detecting small traffic signs.</p></details> |  |

However, existing depth estimation algorithms often struggle to effectively balance performance and computational efficiency, which poses challenges for deployment on resource-constrained devices. To address this, we propose LMDepth, a lightweight Mamba-based monocular depth estimation network, designed to reconstruct high-precision depth information while maintaining low computational overhead. Specifically, we propose a modified pyramid spatial pooling module that serves as a multi-scale feature aggregator and context extractor, ensuring global spatial information for accurate depth estimation. Moreover, we integrate multiple depth Mamba blocks into the decoder. Designed with linear computations, the Mamba Blocks enable LMDepth to efficiently decode depth information from global features, providing a lightweight alternative to Transformer-based architectures that depend on complex attention mechanisms. Extensive experiments on the NYUDv2 and KITTI datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed LMDepth. Compared to previous lightweight depth estimation methods, LMDepth achieves higher performance with fewer parameters and lower computational complexity (measured by GFLOPs). We further deploy LMDepth on an embedded platform with INT8 quantization, validating its practicality for real-world edge applications.</p></details> |  |
| **[Mamba Based Feature Extraction And Adaptive Multilevel Feature Fusion For 3D Tumor Segmentation From Multi-modal Medical Image](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.21281v1)** | 2025-04-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multi-modal 3D medical image segmentation aims to accurately identify tumor regions across different modalities, facing challenges from variations in image intensity and tumor morphology. Traditional convolutional neural network (CNN)-based methods struggle with capturing global features, while Transformers-based methods, despite effectively capturing global context, encounter high computational costs in 3D medical image segmentation. The Mamba model combines linear scalability with long-distance modeling, making it a promising approach for visual representation learning. However, Mamba-based 3D multi-modal segmentation still struggles to leverage modality-specific features and fuse complementary information effectively. In this paper, we propose a Mamba based feature extraction and adaptive multilevel feature fusion for 3D tumor segmentation using multi-modal medical image. We first develop the specific modality Mamba encoder to efficiently extract long-range relevant features that represent anatomical and pathological structures present in each modality. Moreover, we design an bi-level synergistic integration block that dynamically merges multi-modal and multi-level complementary features by the modality attention and channel attention learning. Lastly, the decoder combines deep semantic information with fine-grained details to generate the tumor segmentation map. Experimental results on medical image datasets (PET/CT and MRI multi-sequence) show that our approach achieve competitive performance compared to the state-of-the-art CNN, Transformer, and Mamba-based approaches.</p></details> |  |

Although many works integrate EEs into encoder-only Transformers, their application to decoder-only architectures and, more importantly, Mamba models, a novel family of state-space architectures in the LLM realm, remains insufficiently explored. This work introduces DYNAMAX, the first framework to exploit the unique properties of Mamba architectures for early exit mechanisms. We not only integrate EEs into Mamba but also repurpose Mamba as an efficient EE classifier for both Mamba-based and transformer-based LLMs, showcasing its versatility. Our experiments employ the Mistral 7B transformer compared to the Codestral 7B Mamba model, using data sets such as TruthfulQA, CoQA, and TriviaQA to evaluate computational savings, accuracy, and consistency. The results highlight the adaptability of Mamba as a powerful EE classifier and its efficiency in balancing computational cost and performance quality across NLP tasks. By leveraging Mamba's inherent design for dynamic processing, we open pathways for scalable and efficient inference in embedded applications and resource-constrained environments. This study underscores the transformative potential of Mamba in redefining dynamic computing paradigms for LLMs.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to IJCNN 2025</p></details> |
| **[GPA-RAM: Grasp-Pretraining Augmented Robotic Attention Mamba for Spatial Task Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.19683v1)** | 2025-04-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Most existing robot manipulation methods prioritize task learning by enhancing perception through complex deep network architectures. However, they face challenges in real-time collision-free planning. Hence, Robotic Attention Mamba (RAM) is designed for refined planning. Specifically, by integrating Mamba and parallel single-view attention, RAM aligns multi-view vision and task-related language features, ensuring efficient fine-grained task planning with linear complexity and robust real-time performance. Nevertheless, it has the potential for further improvement in high-precision grasping and manipulation. Thus, Grasp-Pretraining Augmentation (GPA) is devised, with a grasp pose feature extractor pretrained utilizing object grasp poses directly inherited from whole-task demonstrations. Subsequently, the extracted grasp features are fused with the spatially aligned planning features from RAM through attention-based Pre-trained Location Fusion, preserving high-resolution grasping cues overshadowed by an overemphasis on global planning. To summarize, we propose Grasp-Pretraining Augmented Robotic Attention Mamba (GPA-RAM), dividing spatial task learning into RAM for planning skill learning and GPA for grasping skill learning. GPA-RAM demonstrates superior performance across three robot systems with distinct camera configurations in simulation and the real world. Compared with previous state-of-the-art methods, it improves the absolute success rate by 8.2% (from 79.3% to 87.5%) on the RLBench multi-task benchmark and 40\% (from 16% to 56%), 12% (from 86% to 98%) on the ALOHA bimanual manipulation tasks, while delivering notably faster inference. Furthermore, experimental results demonstrate that both RAM and GPA enhance task learning, with GPA proving robust to different architectures of pretrained grasp pose feature extractors.

| **[Mamba in Speech: Towards an Alternative to Self-Attention](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.12609v6)** | 2025-04-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Transformer and its derivatives have achieved success in diverse tasks across computer vision, natural language processing, and speech processing. To reduce the complexity of computations within the multi-head self-attention mechanism in Transformer, Selective State Space Models (i.e., Mamba) were proposed as an alternative. Mamba exhibited its effectiveness in natural language processing and computer vision tasks, but its superiority has rarely been investigated in speech signal processing. This paper explores solutions for applying Mamba to speech processing by discussing two typical speech processing tasks: speech recognition, which requires semantic and sequential information, and speech enhancement, which focuses primarily on sequential patterns. The experimental results confirm that bidirectional Mamba (BiMamba) consistently outperforms vanilla Mamba, highlighting the advantages of a bidirectional design for speech processing. Moreover, experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of BiMamba as an alternative to the self-attention module in the Transformer model and its derivates, particularly for the semantic-aware task. The crucial technologies for transferring Mamba to speech are then summarized in ablation studies and the discussion section, offering insights for extending this research to a broader scope of tasks.</p></details> |  |
